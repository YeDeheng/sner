Why doesn't the .clone copy my div?
I have a problem with my site on which I am trying to clone a div to add it to every nth article.

I have added a script that adds adWrap div to every 7th article.
And it does clone it and it adds the ad to the 7th but then the ad won't re-add itself to the 14th article etc.
It only adds the wrapping.
Any ideas?

Correct js code is

You need to add $ and Parentheses to this you might also want to add : eq (0) I dont know how replaceWith acts when multiple elements are found
