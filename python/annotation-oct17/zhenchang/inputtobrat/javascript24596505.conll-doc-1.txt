adding cookie to angular $http requests (post and get) in an iframe
i have an angular application that runs in an iFrame
the outer application is doing authentication and saving a cookie with jsessionid.
i need my iFrame application to send requests with the cookie that the outer application saved.
i'm using
$ http.post
$ http.get
i have tried to include this on my service module
$ http.defaults.withCredentials = true ;
doesnt seem to work.
any help would be apreciated.
