JConsole Web Application
I need to have the information and operations of my MBeans in my applications and I need this to be as a web application.
My app server is Weblogic 10.3.2
Actually I need an application which can do the things (only about MBeans) like JConsole does (both functionally and visually).
ANy applications u know? or any code examples to do it easilly?
Thanks

Take a look at :
Jolokia : Deploys as a WAR or a JavaAgent and exposes JMX ops and attributes through a REST API.
There ' s no actual console as yet, but check here and here for possible implementations.
OpenDMK : This is the open-sourced Java Dynamic Management Kit.
It contains, among other things, a HTML Protocol Adaptor which provides a very basic browser accessible view of your MBeanServer.
MX4J : Also provides an HTTP Protocol Adaptor.
The last 2 are not particularly active any more, but I can attest to their stability.
