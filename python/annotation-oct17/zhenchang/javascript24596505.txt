adding cookie to angular $http requests (post and get) in an iframe
i have an angular application that runs in an  iFrame 
the outer application is doing authentication and saving a cookie with  jsessionid .
i need my  iFrame  application to send requests with the cookie that the outer application saved.
i'm using  
$http.post 
$http.get  
i have tried to include this on my service module  
$http.defaults.withCredentials = true;  
doesnt seem to work.
any help would be apreciated.
