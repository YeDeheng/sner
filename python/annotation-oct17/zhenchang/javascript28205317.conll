how	O

render	O
child	O
components	O

react.js	B-API
recursively	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
recursively	O
add	O
a	O
react	O
component	O
from	O
within	O
its	O
own	O
component	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
this	O
example	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
component	O
which	O
was	O
mapping	O
through	O
the	O
child	O
TreeNodes	B-API
and	O
adding	O
child	O
nodes	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
.	O

Unfortunately	O
it	O
doesn't	O
work	O
at	O
all	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

The	O
idea	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
simple	O
comment	O
component	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
replies	O
would	O
reuse	O
the	O
same	O
component	O
.	O

I	O
get	O
the	O
following	O
error	O
message	O

Uncaught	O

here	O
is	O
an	O
example	O

the	O
JSON	B-Stan

the	O

hmm	O
,	O
I	O
didn't	O
expect	O
to	O
sort	O
this	O
issue	O
out	O
so	O
quickly	O

But	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
if	O
you	O
create	O
the	O
child	O

an	O

it	O

fine	O

Maybe	O
someone	O

react.js	B-API
can	O
