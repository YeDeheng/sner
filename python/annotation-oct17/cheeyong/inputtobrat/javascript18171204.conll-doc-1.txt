What is the right jQuery (or javaScript) code to pause a basic slider using a simple ' setTimeOut ' funcitonality?
I have built a basic content slider, based upon a tutorial I got from the web.
In the example, the slides scroll on a timed interval using a setTimeout parameter, but also has a navigation functionality (of course) which allows you to go to selected slides directly.
The slides scroll without pausing the Timeout when a slide is selected and obviously when the mouse hovers.
The key javaScript / jQuery code which controls the scrolling is essentially (7 total slides ):
(( Other javaScript code omitted because I was fairly certain that the key is this function, but I can certainly update my question with the precursory code if needed for clarity. ))
The end game is a) to have the Timeout reset whenever a user selects a new slide and b) to have the Timeout pause when a mouse is rolled over the content in the slide.
I presume that the code ought to be inserted in conjunction with the setTimeout, with some if statements or something.
Can someone help me devise this solution for endgame a) and b)?
Live prototype and NOT a shameless plug : HERE
Thanks in advance for tips!
add a check for paused and a variable to hold the timer reference
Then in the choose slide click
Then in mouseover
and mouseout
Alternatively, use a shorter timeout which does almost nothing most times it ' s invoked
Then in the choose slide click
Same as before for mouseover and mouseout
