How to create an JS object from scratch using a HTML button?
Im new to coding.
I have made a bunch of courses online and now i went to create something myself.
This is supposed to be a Scenario Generator for a game.
I would like to have a button on a Website.
Once clicked, a javascript is being run.
This script creates an object from scratch and then outputs text, assembled from the the various props of the object.
scripts.js
This Scenario has a bunch of methods to randomly fill in the blanks.
However, i have not the slighest idea how i can link my HTML button to "call" in the Scenario function, especially considering i would want to be able to click the button more than once, and get a new "randomized" Scenario Output.
Can someone help me?

To use a constructor function, just call it as normal but prefix it with the new operator.
