Decimals such as 0.1 and 0.2 equal 0.30000000000000004
I have a button that, when I press it I want it to update a label (which starts at 0.0) to + 0.1
I get the following :
The code I have is :
I understand that the way computers work with numbers are not exactly 0.3 but more like 0.2999999 ...
I just wanted a way to round the number so I can easily add 0.1 (to) 0.9 together without a mass of decimal places.
I have tried adding
although it rounds it downwards to 0 so the label doesn't update.
Some decimals simply can't be represented by a float or double in such way the the difference is small enough.
Simply because a computer uses the binary number system.
For instance a computer will always fail to represent 1 / 3rd.
You can use a format, to round the number to one decimal using the following code :
If you want exact decimal addition, you need to use BigDecimal in place of double.
