What pointcut method pattern to use for interface with method that returns Collection 
A have a simple interface: 
I want to create an advice for this method when around: 
I Keep getting 
advice defined in
org.example.aspect.TestAspect has not
been applied [Xlint:adviceDidNotMatch] 
What am I doing wrong? 
After a few days i can answer my own question: 
The WARNING "advice defined in org.example.aspect.TestAspect has not been applied [Xlint:adviceDidNotMatch]" is given when there is no call to the mothod findAll(). 
if you create a class that implements the interface test and has a main method that calls findAll(), the warning will vanish.
