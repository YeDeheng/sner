I have a page that uses jQuery ' s $ .post () method to get some html and inside the html is a tag.
My code looks something like this :
Is there a reason that the script tag will not parse in IE = 8?
It parses just fine in every other browser.
I've been searching around on the web for a few hours now and can't seem to find anything on this issue so I'm assuming I'm forgetting something or flat out doing something wrong?
EDIT :
Just found this on the jQuery site (http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax) regarding the html dataType for ajax requests :
"Returns HTML as plain text ; included script tags are evaluated when inserted in the DOM.
"
On a related SO question (jQuery : Cant append script element ): The answer given by @Hendra states this SHOULD be working.
Which still leaves me wondoring why this doesn't work in IE7 / 8.
Using DOM methods to insert a script tag results in the tag being executed.
Just using innerHTML (or some framework that uses it) will NOT result in the script being executed.
This is probably the cause of your problem.
I suggest separating the HTML and JS, then running eval on the JS section.
I found the problem.
My site uses html5 and thus relies on innershiv (http://jdbartlett.com/innershiv) for inserting elements into the dom for non-html5 browsers (for me this would be ie7 / 8)
I had forgotten that we have an automated script that calls innershiv on all jQuery insertion methods (.html (), .append (), etc ..)
The reason this was failing for me is that innershiv was circumventing jQuery ' s script evaluation.
The fix was to do the script evaluation from within the script that calls innershiv.
