store image into a folder in netbeans
I am using a FileChooser for selectiong image from the system.Now I want to store the image into db.For this I have created a new folder image in the project, and my idea is load the folder with the opened images renamed like img1, img2 ... and store this path into the db, at a time one image.
I used the code below for getting the image name
But I dont know how to store the image into the folder.Hope anyone will help to solve this.
I don't see the point of storing the images into your project jar.
It would make more sense to save it into the system.
But then again, why even do that?
Just store the image directly to the database.
To do that just do this
UPDATE
Saving to File system.
You need to specify the path in this line of code
