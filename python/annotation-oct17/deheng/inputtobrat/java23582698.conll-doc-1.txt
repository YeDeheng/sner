Java animation does not refresh properly and uses too much CPU
I have a problem with a simple Java game I am creating right now.
I want a dot (a car) to be movable across the game screen, but instead of this all I can see on the screen is the long "snake" created by the dot moved by me :
Other problem is that activity manager on my Mac shows that the game uses huge amount of CPU power - my laptop gets very hot very fast.
I suspect that there is something wrong with my game loop, but since now I haven't found any solution :
BoardPanel.java :
Car.java
Map.java (I haven't created map yet, right now only want the dot to move properly)
RacerMain.java
Many thanks for your help !!!
In your draw() method you need to clear the BufferedImages background before your invoke the fillOval method.
Something like :
Print out your "waitTime" to make sure you are waiting a reasonable time.
In addition to what camickr said : Be careful with your usage of the Graphics.
A rule of thumb :
Never call getGraphics on a Component!
Additionally, you are never disposing the Graphics that you are fetching from the BufferedImage.
You are instead disposing the Graphics that you obtained from the Component, which may be even worse than fetching it in the first place!
I wonder why you are overriding the addNotify method.
You should not implement any functionality based on averriding this method ....
So you should change the respecive parts of your BoardPanel class roughly as follows :
