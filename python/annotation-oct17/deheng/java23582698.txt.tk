Java animation does not refresh properly and uses too much CPU
I have a problem with a simple Java game I am creating right now . I want a dot ( a car ) to be movable across the game screen , but instead of this all I can see on the screen is the long " snake " created by the dot moved by me :
Other problem is that activity manager on my Mac shows that the game uses huge amount of CPU power - my laptop gets very hot very fast . I suspect that there is something wrong with my game loop , but since now I haven't found any solution :
BoardPanel.java :
Car.java
Map.java ( I haven't created map yet , right now only want the dot to move properly )
RacerMain.java
Many thanks for your help !!!
In your draw() method you need to clear the BufferedImages background before your invoke the fillOval method . Something like :
Print out your " waitTime " to make sure you are waiting a reasonable time .
In addition to what camickr said : Be careful with your usage of the Graphics . A rule of thumb :
Never call getGraphics on a Component !
Additionally , you are never disposing the Graphics that you are fetching from the BufferedImage . You are instead disposing the Graphics that you obtained from the Component , which may be even worse than fetching it in the first place !
I wonder why you are overriding the addNotify method . You should not implement any functionality based on averriding this method ....
So you should change the respecive parts of your BoardPanel class roughly as follows :
