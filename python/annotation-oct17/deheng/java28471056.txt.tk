Android open an EditText link using a button
I've searched around allot on how to open a link that you have entered in an input field ( EditText ) which will open when you press a button .
But sadly , I've only found this .
What I am aiming for is something similar to this , I want to have a default link already stated in the code however when you enter text into the input field , it will add to the default link . For example something like this , default link is : http://www.google.com But when I enter " design " into the input field ( EditText ) and hit the button it will make it : http://www.google.com/design and it'll open the link as that .
How can I achieve this ? I'm new to programming and I've taken a look at the AOSP browser code but it ' s far too complex for me to understand . Hopefully someone could explain how I can achieve something like this , please don't get angry at me because I have seen many new users getting bashed upon asking simple things .
Thanks .
