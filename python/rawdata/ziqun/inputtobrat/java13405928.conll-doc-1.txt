Change JLabel text from another class
I have the following class that draws a Label.
(I have only given part of the code here).
Everyhting works fine, the label gets displayed.
Now, i have another class called Caller Class.
I have a method in that where i will use to change the value of this label. how can i do that
later on, i will be using the following class to change the text of the above label.
How can i do this.
1.
) When the methodA() is executed, the text Hello is not getting displayed on the Label field.
it still remains as Whooo.
How can i correct this.
I want the label text to be Hello once that method has been executed.
The immeditate problem I can see is to appears that you are either using a null layout or your don't understand how layout managers work.
The following code updates the label from the main class in a sub class via a setText method call.
This method is called every second
If you're using a null layout, then stop it.
Just don't.
There are only a very small number of times you would ever use a null layout and I suspect this isn't one of them.
