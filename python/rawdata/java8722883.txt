Executer thread with different actions
One of actions in Struts2 is using below code: 
Here, myTask is inner class which implements Runnable interface. 
Can I invoke the above code from other action class as well by passing parameter a shown below: 
In Run method, I'll check the action   if its add, perform some activity, if its update, perform other activity.... 
Also, from another 3rd action class, can I invoke the same above thread by passing another action, say "update"??? 
Thanks! 
No -  Runnable.run  doesn't take any parameters, so how would you expect the "delete" part to be provided to you? 
Just use the first form - create the  Runnable  instance with  all  the information it needs to know so that it can do its work. Alternatively, I would probably create three different implementations of  Runnable  - one for add, one for delete, and one for update. If you want to do one of three things, why switch on data at execution time when you can use polymorphism? 
If you have a lot of different operations, you could do something like this. Not many Java developers know that enums can be used in this way and thus it can be confusing. Therefore you should use it sparingly, but when it makes sense it can be quite convenient :)  
A much simpler approach is to use an anonymous class.
