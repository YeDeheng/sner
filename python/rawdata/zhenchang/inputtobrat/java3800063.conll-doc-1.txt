Ant standard tasks
Maven has a fairly standardized project structure and standard plugins for compilation and testing.
Is there something widespread for Ant?
I found the following projects so far :
Antiplate
Ant Script Library
But I'm not sure whether these are widespread and are likely to be maintained in the future.
Does someone have experience with them?
I have never heard of them.
I've been on 2 significant Java projects lately.
Our ant tasks were simple and home-grown.
Each time someone starts a new project they make a copy of the ant file and mostly just change some constants at the top.
I know the guy who wrote Ant Script Library.
He doesn't have any intention of stopping.
To me, Ant ' s flexibility makes it hard for things like this to succeed.
Ant-contrib only makes it worse IMHO as it allows people to break the model of the tool.
Shame, as Ant is phenomenally powerful if you use it properly.
