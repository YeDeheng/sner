how to render child components in react.js recursively
I wanted to recursively add a react component from within its own component.
I saw this example of a tree component which was mapping through the child TreeNodes and adding child nodes in the same way.
Unfortunately it doesn't work at all for me.
The idea was to have a simple comment component, and the replies would reuse the same component.
I get the following error message :
Uncaught TypeError : Failed to construct ' Comment ' : Please use the ' new ' operator, this DOM object constructor cannot be called as a function.
here is an example of the JSON data passed to the component.
hmm, I didn't expect to sort this issue out so quickly.
But I found out if you create the child nodes as an object at the top of the render method, it works fine.
Maybe someone more knowledgeable on react.js can give some more feedback on this, but happy to see that it is possible.
