how to render child components in react.js recursively
I wanted to recursively add a react component from within its own component . I saw this example of a tree component which was mapping through the child TreeNodes and adding child nodes in the same way . Unfortunately it doesn't work at all for me . The idea was to have a simple comment component , and the replies would reuse the same component .
I get the following error message :
Uncaught TypeError : Failed to construct ' Comment ' : Please use the ' new ' operator , this DOM object constructor cannot be called as a function .
here is an example of the JSON data passed to the component .
hmm , I didn't expect to sort this issue out so quickly . But I found out if you create the child nodes as an object at the top of the render method , it works fine . Maybe someone more knowledgeable on react.js can give some more feedback on this , but happy to see that it is possible .
