Ant standard tasks
Maven has a fairly standardized project structure and standard plugins for compilation and testing. Is there something widespread for Ant? 
I found the following projects so far: 
Antiplate  
Ant Script Library  
But I'm not sure whether these are widespread and are likely to be maintained in the future. Does someone have experience with them? 
I have never heard of them.  I've been on 2 significant Java projects lately. Our ant tasks were simple and home-grown.  Each time someone starts a new project they make a copy of the ant file and mostly just change some constants at the top. 
I know the guy who wrote Ant Script Library.  He doesn't have any intention of stopping.  To me, Ant's flexibility makes it hard for things like this to succeed.  Ant-contrib only makes it worse IMHO as it allows people to break the model of the tool.  Shame, as Ant is phenomenally powerful if you use it properly.
