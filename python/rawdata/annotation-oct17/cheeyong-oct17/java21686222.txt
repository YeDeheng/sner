How can I make this transformation of an image in Android using Java
Is there a way to process an image / drawable in Android (Java) to make the last X pixels of the image stretch or repeat to the bottom of the screen. I would like to know if this is possible to achieve and if there is a name for this effect or existing algorithm. Thank you in advance. Just please note that I am aware of 9patch images and it is not the way I want to go with, I explicitly need to apply this in code. Thank you in advance, bellow is an image 
You can take a strip from the image and use repeat like this  
EDIT : If you wanted programmatically 
1- crop from the image using this code from  cut the portion of bitmap  : 
2- The returned bitmap , convert it to bitmapdrawable: 
The best option to achieve that is using a   Draw 9-patch   image

Possible algorithm: 
1) get Bitmap object of your image 
2) read image pixels(bitmap.getPixels(...) method) into an int[] array 
3) create a blank bitmap of desired height 
4) use setPixels() method to copy initial bitmap data to a new one 
5) use same method to copy last line to new bitmap as many times as you want(use offset parameter wisely) 
This sounds too complicated for such a small task, but you asked for a way of acheiving it programmatically, so here you go 
EDIT  Easier way for your situation: 
Make use of Shader.TileMode.CLAMP 
1) Create BitmapDrawable from your bitmap or from resources 
2) Use setTileModeY(TilMode.CLAMP);
