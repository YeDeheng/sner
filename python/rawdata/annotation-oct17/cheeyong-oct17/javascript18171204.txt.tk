What is the right jQuery ( or javaScript ) code to pause a basic slider using a simple ' setTimeOut ' funcitonality ?
I have built a basic content slider , based upon a tutorial I got from the web .
In the example , the slides scroll on a timed interval using a setTimeout parameter , but also has a navigation functionality ( of course ) which allows you to go to selected slides directly .
The slides scroll without pausing the Timeout when a slide is selected and obviously when the mouse hovers .
The key javaScript / jQuery code which controls the scrolling is essentially ( 7 total slides ):
(( Other javaScript code omitted because I was fairly certain that the key is this function , but I can certainly update my question with the precursory code if needed for clarity . ))
The end game is a ) to have the Timeout reset whenever a user selects a new slide and b ) to have the Timeout pause when a mouse is rolled over the content in the slide .
I presume that the code ought to be inserted in conjunction with the setTimeout , with some if statements or something . Can someone help me devise this solution for endgame a ) and b ) ?
Live prototype and NOT a shameless plug : HERE
Thanks in advance for tips !
add a check for paused and a variable to hold the timer reference
Then in the choose slide click
Then in mouseover
and mouseout
Alternatively , use a shorter timeout which does almost nothing most times it ' s invoked
Then in the choose slide click
Same as before for mouseover and mouseout
