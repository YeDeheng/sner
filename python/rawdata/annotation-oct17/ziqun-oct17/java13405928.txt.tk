Change JLabel text from another class
I have the following class that draws a Label . ( I have only given part of the code here ) . Everyhting works fine , the label gets displayed .
Now , i have another class called Caller Class . I have a method in that where i will use to change the value of this label . how can i do that
later on , i will be using the following class to change the text of the above label . How can i do this .
1 . ) When the methodA() is executed , the text Hello is not getting displayed on the Label field . it still remains as Whooo . How can i correct this . I want the label text to be Hello once that method has been executed .
The immeditate problem I can see is to appears that you are either using a null layout or your don't understand how layout managers work .
The following code updates the label from the main class in a sub class via a setText method call . This method is called every second
If you're using a null layout , then stop it . Just don't . There are only a very small number of times you would ever use a null layout and I suspect this isn't one of them .
