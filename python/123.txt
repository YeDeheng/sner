Java lib or app to convert CSV to XML file?
 Is there an existing application or library in Java which will allow me to convert a CSV data file to XML file?   
 The XML tags would be provided through possibly the first row containing column headings. 

This is the possible dupliate http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12120055/conversion-of-csv-to-xml-with-java
It seems that this is the first question with the tag of Java in SO.
@Paul Not only that, It's also 123!
