Highcharts with Custom Background in Cross Platform app development
I have a strange Problem with Highcharts display :(
I am using Highcharts in Cross Platform app development.
I am using a custom background for highchart.
It is working very well in iOS but not appearing in Android.
Though chart is there but not visible.
When I remove the background it is working well.
Following is my Code :
Any Idea about this?
