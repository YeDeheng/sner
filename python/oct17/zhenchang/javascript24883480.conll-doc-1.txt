Canvas toDataURL() method is saving low resolution image
I have made a polygonal background generator using HTML5 canvas over at :
http://codepen.io/rfalor/pen/LhinJ
This is the relevant code :
When an user clicks the canvas , and subsequently " Prepare Image " , the image that is saved on right click is of low resolution ( 300px x 150px ) , instead of the canvas resolution . How do I allow the user to save a higher resolution image ?
The problem is you're sizing the canvas using css rather than the width and height properties of the canvas element . When you do that you're only stretching the canvas not increasing the coordinate space of the element .
I added the following to your code
Then I had to change your randomize function a bit to accept a number since it wont always be 500 ;
And you can now call your lineTo ' s like this
However I realize you probably want it to be more than the width and height so you don't see the edges of the shapes but I figure you can fix that up .
