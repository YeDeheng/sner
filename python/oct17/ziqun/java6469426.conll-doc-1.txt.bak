What pointcut method pattern to use for interface with method that returns Collection
A have a simple interface :
I want to create an advice for this method when around :
I Keep getting
advice defined in
org.example.aspect.TestAspect has not
been applied [ Xlint : adviceDidNotMatch ]
What am I doing wrong?
After a few days i can answer my own question :
The WARNING "advice defined in org.example.aspect.TestAspect has not been applied [ Xlint : adviceDidNotMatch ]" is given when there is no call to the mothod findAll().
if you create a class that implements the interface test and has a main method that calls findAll(), the warning will vanish.
