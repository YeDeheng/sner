spring 4.0.2 schema error
I am trying to upgrade my spring 3.4 application to spring 4.0.2
I imported all the spring-4.0.2 jar files but am getting errors in the dispatcher-servlet.xml
if I use this code , I get Referenced file contains errors ( http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-4.0.xsd )
I tried to remove the - 4.0 from the xsd references but I get same error on spring-mvc-xsd now .
I even tried to discard everything and just copy the xml from the spring reference documentation as follow
but with this simple file I get error on
cvc-complex-type.2.4.c : the matching wildcard is strict , but no declaration can be found of element ' mvcannotation-driven
Any example I take from spring4.0 reference document , gives me same error .
is this a problem with spring4.0.2 or am I missing something ?
Thank you for your help
