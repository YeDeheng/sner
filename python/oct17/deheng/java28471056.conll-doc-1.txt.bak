Android open an EditText link using a button
I've searched around allot on how to open a link that you have entered in an input field (EditText) which will open when you press a button.
But sadly, I've only found this.
What I am aiming for is something similar to this, I want to have a default link already stated in the code however when you enter text into the input field, it will add to the default link.
For example something like this, default link is : http://www.google.com But when I enter "design" into the input field (EditText) and hit the button it will make it : http://www.google.com/design and it'll open the link as that.
How can I achieve this?
I'm new to programming and I've taken a look at the AOSP browser code but it ' s far too complex for me to understand.
Hopefully someone could explain how I can achieve something like this, please don't get angry at me because I have seen many new users getting bashed upon asking simple things.
Thanks.
