HTML: XML data island won't link
I can't get my htm file to link with my xml file, or if it is linking I can't get it to work. 
This for a class I'm taking and I know data islands are practically extinct now, but that doesn't change my assignment. 
So, I have the XML and the HTM, I have looked at 4 different sources and can't see anything wrong with my code that links the two but it doesn't seem to work and that goes for my whole body section as well. Can anyone see what's wrong? 
Thanks!
