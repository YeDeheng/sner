jQuery slide toggle checkbox cant change background colour
I am trying to change the background colour of the toggle to green when it is turned on. I think I have done everything correctly, but the background just stays grey. 
What am I doing wrong? 
Here is my fiddle  @codeSnippetRemoved
Thanks in advance. 
Add the style @codeSnippetRemoved
Demo:  Fiddle  
If you change the following, its working: @codeSnippetRemoved
So basically just  background:  instead of  background-color:

you need to add this to your css. This will prevent the override you are currently getting @codeSnippetRemoved
This CSS will solve your problem @codeSnippetRemoved
You are defining the colour of  .slider-button  as white.   .slider-button  is nested inside  .slider-frame .   slider-frame  is given the additional CSS rule that makes it green  The green isn't showing because the background colour of the element within it is still white.  
Solution... 
Change  @codeSnippetRemoved
to... @codeSnippetRemoved
So you are now changing the colour of  .slider-button , not  .slider-frame  
Fiddle me this.
