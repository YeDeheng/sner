Android: Loop to pick a random images from ArrayList
Right now my program randomly displays 5 random images from my Array List and here's the main part of what I have now: @codeSnippetRemoved
I'm now getting an error in my render method here that is causing the app to crash: @codeSnippetRemoved
What I'm trying to do is make each drawable image have an integer value such as: R.drawable.one equal to 1, R.drawable.two equal to 2.....R.drawable.five equal to 5. 
And have a loop repeat until the images displayed equals a total value of 50 (they all add up to 50) and then stop. 
I'm trying to get myImgCount and totalImgCount to keep track of the value of the image that is randomly chosen and I know it isn't right but I can't find any info on how to complete this task. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help, I'm new to coding so if you can explain why you used your code it would help even more! Thanks!  
You can use the drawable naming convention as R.drawable.image1, R.drawable.image2 and use  @codeSnippetRemoved
Details on  getIdentifier  method  here : 
Hope this helps
