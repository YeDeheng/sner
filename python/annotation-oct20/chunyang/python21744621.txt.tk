Exception Handling : exception being handled multiple times
I have a python script which downloads certain data from the internet ( from a list of URLS ) and stores it in a MySQL database . My code is something along these lines : @codeSnippetRemoved
The data which I fetch could be duplicate and I don't want the duplicate data to be inserted into the database and the code should go over the next iteration etch the next data instead of storing the data . So I have the except mdb.IntegrityError : line there which takes care of the duplicates .
However , after catching the exception for the duplicate entry the code , instead of going over the next iteration goes to the except which I have set for the for loop . Here ' s what I get : @codeSnippetRemoved
Why does this happen ? And how do I prevent from happening this ?
Thanks a lot !
Your e would not be defined causing exception in your except block.Use mdb.IntegrityError , e like you did for except mdb.Error , e
