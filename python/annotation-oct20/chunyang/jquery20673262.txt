jQuery library-like pattern
I'm wanting to develop a library following some interesting patterns of jQuery (Builder and Prototype, basically). I tried to read the jQuery source and search for tutorials but did not get anywhere. 
My idea is to allow access of this type: 
grace(...)  is callable directly   grace.set(...)  can have methods   grace.fn.get = ...  can set new methods  
The most I got was this  : @codeSnippetRemoved
It is callable directly, but their methods are not accessible. 
An  extend  method is supposed to add to  grace  and  grance.fn , and when you want to add new methods to  grace , use  grace.extend ; when you want to add new methods to instances that  grace()  creates, use  grace.fn.extend . Take a look at code below: @codeSnippetRemoved
Note:   grace.fn.init.prototype = grance.fn  is needed because  new grace.fn.init(options)  will get an object inherits methods from  grace.init.prototype . Without that line of code, you won't get these methods of  grace.fn . 
Sorry for my poor english, and sorry for not having runnable code. Hope code above will inspire you.
