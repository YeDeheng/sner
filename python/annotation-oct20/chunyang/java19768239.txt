Execute While in SQl Script in Java
i want to execute the SQL Script below, therefore i used ibatis Script Runner @codeSnippetRemoved
But there is the Problem, that While loops will not  be completely executed.I pointed out that the problem comes because the Script Runner didn t wait until he while loop is completely done. So there are only 386 and not 1000 rows created.I got the same Problem using the Java Statement execute method( http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html ): @codeSnippetRemoved
But if i set  @codeSnippetRemoved
behind stmnt.execute the while loop is completeley done and i get 1000 rows like i wanted.So my question is, if it is possible to execute the complete While loop whitout using Thread.sleep.? 
Thank you in advance!  @codeSnippetRemoved
You can refer to below example from  MKYONG  for same. Hope this helps you out. @codeSnippetRemoved
Without having  ScriptRunner  at hand, a possible solution might be to use a procedure and then calling the procedure in the script. @codeSnippetRemoved
