print information from the database on a predefined printed form
I want to print information from the database on a predefined printed form .
I have a printed form and i have got all information related to that form in the database . I would like to print that information at proper places on the form . I just want to print the information and not other predefined instructions . For example , in the below form only the blue text would change from the database
Can anyone please suggest a way to do this ? Thanks for help
You can do this with one of many pdf classes . Start by putting the pdf in the background and then call the text from the database and place it where you want . I'm a fan of the EZPDF Class . It ' s easy to use , well documented , and will do exactly what you're looking for . I've done it many times .
You can use CSS alignment and positioning of data on web page . As Ryan said before , PDF classes will help you through this . Is your data goes directly to printing after retrieval from database ?
Thanks Ryan for suggesting EZPDF class and everyone else for responses .
I find EZPDF class ( suggested by Ryan ) little bit tricky and thought it might take much time . So , I went with different approach . I created pdf with fillable form ( using Adobe Acrobat ) and then used createFDF to fill in the places and print the form
