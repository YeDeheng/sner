I	O

@codeSnippetRemoved	O

Maybe	O
your	O

loads	O
twice	O
,	O
therefore	O
executes	O
the	O

You	O
could	O

something	O

Is	O
this	O

You	O

If	O
it	O

maybe	O

the	O

As	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
browser	O
plugin	O
issue	O
,	O
specifically	O
ySlow	O
2.1.0	O
on	O
Firefox	B-Fram
4.0.1	O

I	O
asked	O
our	O
server	O
manager	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
the	O
problem	O
and	O
he	O
reported	O
that	O
the	O
log	O
was	O
showing	O
two	O
hits	O
every	O
time	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
page	O
.	O

He	O
tried	O
loading	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
machine	O
and	O
the	O
script	O
worked	O
properly	O
and	O
only	O
loaded	O
once	O
.	O

I	O
tried	O
myself	O
on	O
Chrome	B-Fram
and	O
it	O
worked	O
,	O
only	O
emailing	O
once	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
through	O
my	O
various	O
add-ons	O
and	O
finally	O
isolated	O
ySlow	O
as	O
the	O
culprit	O
.	O

Not	O
sure	O
if	O
this	O
means	O
that	O
ySlow	O
is	O
loading	O
every	O
page	O
twice	O
or	O
what	O
,	O
but	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
disabled	O

If	O
anyone	O
has	O
any	O
suggestions	O
about	O
fixing	O
the	O
problem	O
with	O
ySlow	O

please	O

me	O

Just	O
in	O
case	O

I	O
discovered	O
my	O
code	O

a	O
