Stream android camera over RTMP
I was searching in all stackoverflow posts , but not find ask for this question.I need stream video from android camera to rtmp server. In this time, I make rtmp packet, put in rtmp body buffer from pipe: @codeSnippetRemoved
Settings for media: @codeSnippetRemoved
Then reading data from inputStream into array and put this data to rtmpbodyIm understand, thats wrong, but I have no idea how make raw h264 streamable 
Maybe you already did, if not, you should take a look to these questions. 
Accessing the output video while recording  
Transfer InputStream to another Service (across process boundaries) with ParcelFileDescriptor.createPipe() failes with  EBADF (Bad file number)   
I've got a small project that shows how to put raw h264 into an RTMP format  here ; its not perfect, but it mostly works.
