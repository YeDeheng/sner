jQuery Multiple conditionals with isNumeric
I'm trying to figure out what the best practice is with a couple of things.  
Whether having  if  statements inside of  if  statements is a bad thing.   If there is a better way to condense my code so I'm not chaining a bunch of logical operators chained together.   
Also I can't figure out why my  isNumeric  is not working, I've got a really simple form with a couple of input boxes and I'm looping around them in myjquery. What happens is I can input a string of letters that is > 5 and it won'thit the  isNumeric  conditional. Ideally a user has to enter numbers for this.Any ideas? @codeSnippetRemoved
You're passing a wrong parameter to the  isNumeric  function. This line @codeSnippetRemoved
should be @codeSnippetRemoved
As for the long list of conditionals, you can refactor them into a separate function with a name that reflects its purpose. In this case for example, you could create a function like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
Then it looks cleaner like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
