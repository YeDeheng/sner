python inserting variable string as file name
I'm trying to create a file file a unique file name, every time my script is ran, it's only intended to be weekly or monthly. so I chose to use the date for the file name.  @codeSnippetRemoved
is where I'm getting this error.  @codeSnippetRemoved
it works if I use a static filename, is there an issue with the open function, that means you can't pass a string like this? 
name is a string and has values such as :  @codeSnippetRemoved
Many thanks for any help 
you can do something like @codeSnippetRemoved
or  f = open('%s.csv' % name, 'wb')  
You need to put  % name  straight after the string: @codeSnippetRemoved
The reason your code doesn't work is because you are trying to  %  a file, which isn't string formatting, and is also invalid. 
And with the new string formatting method... @codeSnippetRemoved
