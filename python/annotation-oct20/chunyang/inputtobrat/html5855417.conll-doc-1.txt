How to getlength of a string in tcpdf?
In TCPDF there is @codeSnippetRemoved
for measuring the height of a cell.But how do you measure the length or width of a string (or block of string) in TCPDF?
You can easily find this kind of answers at the http://www.tcpdf.org and official forum.
Anyway, the method to get the string length is GetStringWidth().
Check also the getNumLines() and getStringHeight() methods.
The source code documentation is at http://www.tcpdf.org
