Use variables from other class from other file to another in java
There are two players who will input their name in the JTextFields.
What I want to do is that the data I entered from the Welcome frame in Enter.java will be transferred to the JLabels in ActualGame.java.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Main is the main class that holds the JFrame of ActualGame() and also the main class of Enter().
@codeSnippetRemoved
the ActualGame : @codeSnippetRemoved
What should I do to be able to use the String variable one and two from Enter.java to ActualGame.java?I'm new and noob in programming especially java swing.
Open to criticisms and suggestions.
Thank you.
Suggestions :
Passing information from one object to another is no different with Swing as with other Java programs.
You can call methods or constructors and pass information in via parameters.
A key difference though is when to pass information.
With event driven programs, this is often triggered by an event, a listener, and so use of the observer design pattern is comment.
For your purposes, the first window could be a modal dialog such as a JOptionPane or a modal JDialog which will make it easier to figure out when to pass information.
When using a modal dialog, all code flow in the calling program is paused while the dialog is visible, and then resumes once the dialog is no longer visible.
It ' s easy then to have the calling program query the dialog once this occurs, because you'll know precisely where in your code this will occur.
You'll want to avoid excessive showing of different windows in your application as it can quickly get annoying to the user.
A few dialogs here and there are OK, especially if you need the information to be given in a modal fashion, but in general it ' s better to swap GUI "views" when needed, and a CardLayout is good for this.
But having said this, separate views are often created by separate classes, so the problem of passing information back and forth remains a problem with similar solutions as described above.
Specifically, give your Enter class a getText method that will allow other objects to query it for the state of its JTextField : @codeSnippetRemoved
Also, change your ActualGame class so that it can accept String information when needed : @codeSnippetRemoved
e.g., @codeSnippetRemoved
Try to make ActualGam as a underclass of Enter @codeSnippetRemoved
