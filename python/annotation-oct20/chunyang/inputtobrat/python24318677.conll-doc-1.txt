Drawing a custom diagram in python
I wanna draw something like this :
The closest thing to this I could find was NetworkX Edge Colormap :
http://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/examples/drawing/edge_colormap.html
and here is the source code : @codeSnippetRemoved
After playing around with their source code, I can't figure out how to hardcode distance of the edge circles from the centre.
Right now its random.
Also how do I label the edge circles and their distance from the centre?
I know for position comes from pos= nx.spring_layout (G).
So I looked at the spring_layout attribute and found that position can be specified by using a pos variable which is a dictionary with nodes as keys and values as a list.
(https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html)
But even when I do the following result is random edges : @codeSnippetRemoved
I'm trying to be as helpful as I can.
I wouldn't try to keep them static.
You'll want to add and remove things, and the algorithm ' s automatic placement is something you don't want to lose.
According to the docs, you should probably tweak k.
It looks like n is 20, so multiply k times some factor to increase the distance.
@codeSnippetRemoved
should maybe be this : @codeSnippetRemoved
You can set the node positions explicitly with the pos dictionary.For example @codeSnippetRemoved
