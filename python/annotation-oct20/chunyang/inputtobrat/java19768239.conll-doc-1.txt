Execute While in SQl Script in Java
i want to execute the SQL Script below, therefore i used ibatis Script Runner @codeSnippetRemoved
But there is the Problem, that While loops will not be completely executed.I pointed out that the problem comes because the Script Runner didn t wait until he while loop is completely done.
So there are only 386 and not 1000 rows created.I got the same Problem using the Java Statement execute method (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/sql/Statement.html ): @codeSnippetRemoved
But if i set @codeSnippetRemoved
behind stmnt.execute the while loop is completeley done and i get 1000 rows like i wanted.So my question is, if it is possible to execute the complete While loop whitout using Thread.sleep .?
Thank you in advance!

You can refer to below example from MKYONG for same.
Hope this helps you out.

Without having ScriptRunner at hand, a possible solution might be to use a procedure and then calling the procedure in the script.
