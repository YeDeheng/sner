jQuery library-like pattern
I'm wanting to develop a library following some interesting patterns of jQuery (Builder and Prototype, basically).
I tried to read the jQuery source and search for tutorials but did not get anywhere.
My idea is to allow access of this type :
grace (...) is callable directly grace.set (...) can have methods grace.fn.get = ... can set new methods
The most I got was this : @codeSnippetRemoved
It is callable directly, but their methods are not accessible.
An extend method is supposed to add to grace and grance.fn, and when you want to add new methods to grace, use grace.extend ; when you want to add new methods to instances that grace() creates, use grace.fn.extend.
Take a look at code below : @codeSnippetRemoved
Note : grace.fn.init.prototype = grance.fn is needed because new grace.fn.init (options) will get an object inherits methods from grace.init.prototype.
Without that line of code, you won't get these methods of grace.fn.
Sorry for my poor english, and sorry for not having runnable code.
Hope code above will inspire you.
