jQuery Multiple conditionals with isNumeric
I'm trying to figure out what the best practice is with a couple of things.
Whether having if statements inside of if statements is a bad thing.
If there is a better way to condense my code so I'm not chaining a bunch of logical operators chained together.
Also I can't figure out why my isNumeric is not working, I've got a really simple form with a couple of input boxes and I'm looping around them in myjquery.
What happens is I can input a string of letters that is > 5 and it won'thit the isNumeric conditional.
Ideally a user has to enter numbers for this.Any ideas?

You're passing a wrong parameter to the isNumeric function.
This line @codeSnippetRemoved
should be @codeSnippetRemoved
As for the long list of conditionals, you can refactor them into a separate function with a name that reflects its purpose.
In this case for example, you could create a function like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
Then it looks cleaner like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
