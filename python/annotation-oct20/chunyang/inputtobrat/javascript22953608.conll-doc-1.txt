Jquery - Read input from Text Field
I have a form which will populate a select box "city" based on the selections of another select box "suburb".
This works for my data.

Instead of having the select id= "suburb" box I would like to make it a text input input type= "text" name= "suburb" and use the value in the input text field to populate the city select box.
I have tried changing it to
@codeSnippetRemoved
But this doesn't return anything.
Im sure Im not reading the input in the "suburb" field correctly
Since you give your input name attribute, you can target it by name instead of id : @codeSnippetRemoved
try this @codeSnippetRemoved
