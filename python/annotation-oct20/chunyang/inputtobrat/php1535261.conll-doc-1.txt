How to write an efficient hit counter for websites
I want to write a hit counter script to keep track of hits on images on a website and the originating IPs.
Impressions are upwards of hundreds of thousands per day, so the counters will be incremented many times a second.
I'm looking for a simple, self-hosted method (php, python scripts, etc.).
I was thinking of using MySQL to keep track of this, but I'm guessing there ' s a more efficient way.
What are good methods of keeping counters?
Well if you happen to go the PHP route you could use an SQLite database, however MySQL is a perfectly reasonable way to store that info and usually (at least from the ones I've seen) is how it is done.
If you didn't want to store IP address and any other info a simple number in atext file could work.
A fascinating subject.
