redirect GET data to another site with PHP
So I have a form on the front end . I use jQuery to collect and send the data to collect.php .
I want collect.php to send the to another site in the following format ? fname=tom phone=3434343 .
How do I simply send the data that is sent to collect.php to this other site ?
use get method for generating query string i.e ? fname=tom phone=3434343 .
Set action to the site url you want the form to get submit @codeSnippetRemoved

How To ? Form Post to Multiple Locations
The best way to go about it would be to first submit the form to your local script , then use CURL to POST the ( filtered ) data that was received to the remote script . Then just watch for the response . Then simply send the email and process the response from the remote script in your local one .
If you want to send it in an invisible way via PHP , you might use CURL extension ( usually already integrated ) , you have a tutorial here : http://www.binarytides.com/php-curl-tutorial-beginners
I understand your question like you had send the data in a form on your collect.php then you want again to send the data from collect.php to another page e.g anotherpage.php . Correct me if that is not what you want to do .
If so , why not use again jquery in your collect.php @codeSnippetRemoved
Hope it helps .....
Since you have already collected data and sent it to collect.php , you probably will have to do something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
This will let send the data to another site from your PHP script .
If you also need to provide an user agent string or refer ( as in - fake a browser ) , then you should look in to options provided by curl_setopt() .
The alternative solution would be to use sockets , but that would need you to explore HTTP protocol itself .
