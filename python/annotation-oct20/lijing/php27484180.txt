Slow user input on firefox, but not chrome
I have a web page with a little over 1000 text inputs and 100 check boxes created in the following way: 
echo" td  input type='text' id='".$a."-".$b."-inc"."' autocomplete='off'  /td ";  
the input freezes momentarily when switching between input elements and typing. at first i thought the problem was that firefox retains information on refresh, but with the autocomplete property it no longer does. 
when i check the profiler the profiler says messageQueue.push is the culprit.   
I am especially confused as chrome is perfectly fine. 
any idea what is slowing the input and how to fix it? 
I think it is because you are using a table. Use div's instead of tables, that's a lot faster. @codeSnippetRemoved
