I cannot run Enmbedded RavenDB
I was able to successfully run a simple test for RavenDB based on the code found at:  http://ravendb.net/tutorials/hello-world  
Next I tried to run it in an Embedded Manner, but I keep on getting the following error:   @codeSnippetRemoved
Setup:   
Target framework is  .NET Framework 4  
I added the following References to my project: 
\RavenDB-Build-309\EmbeddedClient\Raven.Client.Embedded.dll  \RavenDB-Build-309\Client\Raven.Client.Lightweight.dll  \RavenDB-Build-309\EmbeddedClient\Raven.Storage.Esent.dll  \RavenDB-Build-309\EmbeddedClient\Raven.Storage.Managed.dll  
The code is:  @codeSnippetRemoved
I have tried searching for this for a few days and tried a few different variations too.  I am not sure what's going on. 
Thanks to Ayende Rahien on groups.google.com/group/ravendb/topics. 
The solution was to add "Raven.Storage.Esent" reference to the main project.  It's an issue with Visual Studio and indirect references. 
Thanks @Derek for suggesting that I post there.

You need to add a reference to Raven.Storage.Esent.dll
