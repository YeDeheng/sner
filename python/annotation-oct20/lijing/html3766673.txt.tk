How to make my button into an Image button ?
I have a default button . So now how do I make it a button image ? So when you click on the button the normal thing happens . What I just want is an Image on the button . Thanks .
Try putting an image instead of a button and handle its onclick event .
You can use an image as a button by specifying the src property : @codeSnippetRemoved
you can use javascript with some logic .
create one button with style attribute style= " display :b lock " also create required image just next to button with style= " display : none "
onclick of button call javascript function . @codeSnippetRemoved
This should work
you could try : @codeSnippetRemoved
You may try this : @codeSnippetRemoved
