Access inline JSON in Polymer
I am making a d3.js map component with Polymer . The topology data needs to be loaded from a json file and since I don't want the component to be dependent on a URL / URI , I am using inline JSON instead of loading it using AJAX : @codeSnippetRemoved
But obviously topdata element doesn't have the method html() .
Is it the right thing to do ? and how vulcanize deal with this ?
You're not depending on an external resource but it ' s still in a separate file . I'd use core-ajax to load it : @codeSnippetRemoved
http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-ajax
There is no need to inline JSON file . Polymer ' s resolvePath function is useful here to make sure the relative path to JSON file is always correct regardless of where the component is included : @codeSnippetRemoved
Info about resolvePath here .
