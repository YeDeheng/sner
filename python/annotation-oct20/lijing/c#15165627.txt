Issue parsing JSON object response to C# object
I have the following code: @codeSnippetRemoved
when I run it the string aRespStr is:  
"{\"addResults\":[{\"objectId\":28,\"globalId\":\"{740490C6-77EE-4AC0-9561-5EBAACE3A0A7}  \",\"success\":true}]}"  
I created the following classes to hold the object once I deserialize it: @codeSnippetRemoved
but when I run the code the addResult object contains the default object values not the json object values. 
The api for this particular response is here: http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/apis/rest/fsadd.html  
any help on getting this to work is greatly appreciated 
change  @codeSnippetRemoved
to @codeSnippetRemoved
Try this  @codeSnippetRemoved
or similary you can try this @codeSnippetRemoved
as you are returning list of AddResult in your json Response. 
And Change the content type to application/json
