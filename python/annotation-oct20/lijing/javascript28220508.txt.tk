D3 Update Multi line Chart
I am a newcomer to both D3 and JavaScript . I have been working on code for a multi-line chart that would do the following :
have focus and context via brushing have an interactive legend have a vertical line and labeled dot on hover update with new data .
I have been able to get it to do 1 through 3 but I am really stuck when it comes to ( 4 ) updating .
The code will load a file called data.csv of the format Date , RAW , RTX 2015-01-29 09:02 : 40 , 392 , 318 2015-01-29 09:03 : 39 , 393 , 312 2015-01-29 09:04 : 41 , 396 , 312
On update it will reload data.csv which will have new data appended to it , e.g. ,
Date , RAW , RTX 2015-01-29 09:02 : 40 , 392 , 318 2015-01-29 09:03 : 39 , 393 , 312 2015-01-29 09:04 : 41 , 396 , 312 2015-01-29 09:05 : 40 , 390 , 310 2015-01-29 09:06 : 50 , 392 , 313
I have written it so I don t have to know the column names or the number of columns beforehand .
The problem is that on the update everything still works ; the axis update , the line moves , the brush works , the interactive legend works but the lines don t show the new data values . I am truly stuck and any suggestions would be much appreciated .
To get this far I relied heavily on some really great pages , http://bl.ocks.org/DStruths/9c042e3a6b66048b5bd4 http://www.delimited.io/blog/2014/3/3/creating-multi-series-charts-in-d3-lines-bars-area-and-streamgraphs
