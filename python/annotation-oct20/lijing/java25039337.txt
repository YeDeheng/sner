JAXB Marshaling Doubled XML data
When I'm saving 2 objects 4 are actually saved (doubled). Got object A and B and instead of output XML file where are saved AB I got XML where is ABAB.  
My Classes: @codeSnippetRemoved
This is the wrapper: @codeSnippetRemoved
and this is method used in main-app: @codeSnippetRemoved
My output is: @codeSnippetRemoved
But should be: @codeSnippetRemoved
Can you help me figure this out? 
I believe the annotations on  Wrapper  are the problem.  because you are explicitly annotating the private member with  XmlElement , you are actually getting output from both the private member and the public getter/setter methods. 
if you want to use field level access, annotate the  Wrapper  class with  @XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD) .  otherwise, move your XmlElement annotation to the getter method.
