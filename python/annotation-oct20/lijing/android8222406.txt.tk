Android HTTPS Post - Not working
I've been trying for ages to get this to work - but no matter what I do , my HTTP * S * POST always yields HttpUtils : javax.net.ssl.SSLException : Not trusted server certificate
Basically I followed this tutorial
I successfully grabbed the public certificate ( mycert.pem ) from theserver . I successfully created a keystore from the certificate using Bouncy Castle I failed at implementing a custom Apache HttpClient . Here is mycode : @codeSnippetRemoved
And in my HTTP Request class that constructs the POST : @codeSnippetRemoved
My POST works fine for non-https websites . Any help would be greatly appreciated it .
Look at the error message :
HttpUtils : javax.net.ssl.SSLException : Not trusted server certificate
This means exactly what it says -- the server is not using a trusted certificate . I bet you'll get similar errors if you try to access the same server with Firefox or IE .
Use This Class To get Your HttpClient.And Check if it helps .
package com.android.MyCellFamily.DAHttp ; @codeSnippetRemoved
Sometimes https url shows blank white screen in the android webview . It ' s because you have to trust the ssl certification or you need to override the ssl error in your webview client .
The following webview client provides the needed functions to access https url.here shouldOverrideUrlLoading is used for to allow the redirecting url within the webview , onReceivedSslError this oneiIgnore SSL certificate errors to access the https url .
Webviewclient : @codeSnippetRemoved
