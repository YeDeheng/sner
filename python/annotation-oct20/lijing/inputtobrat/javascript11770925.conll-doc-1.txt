Django : Password check returning false in view when it should return true
As part of form validation, the password and password2 are compared.
This is part of a simplified ajax request system for an extremely small site returning small amounts of data (so i don't use JSON).
The idea / objective / summery of the program is that it tries to log in the user.
If the user does not exist, it asks the client side to load / reveal the form for new users (just an added password2 field and asks for a pen name).
Here is the file, I've marked the sport where the program freezes with #*********
Forms.py (error is not here ): @codeSnippetRemoved
Views.py, where the error is : @codeSnippetRemoved
The django debug page says the following : @codeSnippetRemoved
The post variable stuff in the error is this (I blanked out my email and ): @codeSnippetRemoved
Just in case the problem is here, I've included the javascript file.
@codeSnippetRemoved
I just noticed that I used the wrong fields in the forms.py file.
Problem solved.
