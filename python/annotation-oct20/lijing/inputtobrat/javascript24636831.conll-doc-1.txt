Access inline JSON in Polymer
I am making a d3.js map component with Polymer.
The topology data needs to be loaded from a json file and since I don't want the component to be dependent on a URL / URI, I am using inline JSON instead of loading it using AJAX : @codeSnippetRemoved
But obviously topdata element doesn't have the method html().
Is it the right thing to do? and how vulcanize deal with this?
You're not depending on an external resource but it ' s still in a separate file.
I'd use core-ajax to load it : @codeSnippetRemoved
http://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/core-elements.html#core-ajax
There is no need to inline JSON file.
Polymer ' s resolvePath function is useful here to make sure the relative path to JSON file is always correct regardless of where the component is included : @codeSnippetRemoved
Info about resolvePath here.
