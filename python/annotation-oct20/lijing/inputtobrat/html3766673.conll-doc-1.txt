How to make my button into an Image button?
I have a default button.
So now how do I make it a button image?
So when you click on the button the normal thing happens.
What I just want is an Image on the button.
Thanks.
Try putting an image instead of a button and handle its onclick event.
You can use an image as a button by specifying the src property : @codeSnippetRemoved
you can use javascript with some logic.
create one button with style attribute style= "display :b lock" also create required image just next to button with style= "display : none"
onclick of button call javascript function.
@codeSnippetRemoved
This should work
you could try : @codeSnippetRemoved
You may try this : @codeSnippetRemoved
