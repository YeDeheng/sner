checkbox operation in jsp
I am trying this one to solve since last night but could not hence asking for help.
There are two pages, such as name.jsp and roll.jsp.
In name.jsp there are two input text boxes and one checkbox.I entered data in two text boxes and i checked the check box, when i checked the check box i am going to roll.jsp and in roll.jsp 2 text boxes are present.
When I reached roll.jsp by clicking checkbox, I kept the link (name.jsp) on roll.jsp page and when i am clicking name.jsp I am not able to see my previously entered data on two textboxes.
How can i achieve this?
I am going to roll.jsp through a checkbox and i want to see all my previously entered data on name.jsp when i am clicking name.jsp hyperlink which is present in roll.jsp.
How to achieve it?
Two different forms are in these two pages.
Any help is much appreciated
On event of click, if that checkbox is checked, make a call for roll.jsp, which will submit the value of current 2 textbox as well as it will show in roll.jsp.
For showing the previously entered values, accept using request.getParameter (string) and print that in roll.jsp.
Whatever the response will come from roll.jsp, print that is one div.
Hope your problem is solved.
