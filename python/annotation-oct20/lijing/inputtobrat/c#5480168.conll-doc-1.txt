I cannot run Enmbedded RavenDB
I was able to successfully run a simple test for RavenDB based on the code found at : http://ravendb.net/tutorials/hello-world
Next I tried to run it in an Embedded Manner, but I keep on getting the following error : @codeSnippetRemoved
Setup :
Target framework is .NET Framework 4
I added the following References to my project :
\ RavenDB-Build-309 \EmbeddedClient\ Raven.Client.Embedded.dll \ RavenDB-Build-309 \Client\ Raven.Client.Lightweight.dll \ RavenDB-Build-309 \EmbeddedClient\ Raven.Storage.Esent.dll \ RavenDB-Build-309 \EmbeddedClient\ Raven.Storage.Managed.dll
The code is : @codeSnippetRemoved
I have tried searching for this for a few days and tried a few different variations too.
I am not sure what ' s going on.
Thanks to Ayende Rahien on groups.google.com/group/ravendb/topics.
The solution was to add "Raven.Storage.Esent" reference to the main project.
It ' s an issue with Visual Studio and indirect references.
