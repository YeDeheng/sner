Java Recursion Over A Text File
I have a text file that represents a building.
A building has floors, and floors have rooms.
The first floor is floor 0.
The text file is structured like so : @codeSnippetRemoved
Where North, East, South, West, Up and Down are integers denoting the room that direction leads to.
The integer -1 is used to denote that there is no exit in that direction.
This is repeated for the number of rooms the building has.
So for four rooms the contents of the text file may be : @codeSnippetRemoved
I'm trying to write a recursive function that will allow me to calculate the number of floors in the building based on the up values.
For example, if we have a room that goes up to room 1, and room 1 goes up to room 2 and that no other rooms go higher than this then we know that there are 3 floors.
I know how to use either a BufferedReader or Scanner object to read the text file but the recursion is what I'm concerned about.
I want to say thank-you in advance, the community here is amazing.
My method to calculate the number of floors (incomplete and may be wrong ): @codeSnippetRemoved
Ok I edited my idea :
So what we need to do : We visit each room and follow all possible ways from that room.
If we go up we add +1, if we go down we substract -1 and if we stay on the same level we dont add a value.Also we need to keep track for the rooms already visited to not go in cycles.

This should work (just add the code to find the directions values of the current room) in my opinioin.
public int calculateFloors (int count) { Scanner scanner ; int count=1 ; try { scanner = new Scanner (currentMap ); // uses count to work out what rooms we can skip for (int i=0 ; i count*6) scanner.nextLine() ; // gets the value of up int up = Integer.parseInt (scanner.nextLine() ); // our base case --- if there are no more floors, return the number --- otherwise perform the recursive call.
