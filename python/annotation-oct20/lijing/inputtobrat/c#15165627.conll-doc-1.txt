Issue parsing JSON object response to C# object
I have the following code : @codeSnippetRemoved
when I run it the string aRespStr is :
"{\" addResults\ ":[ {\" objectId\ ": 28, \" globalId\ ":\" { 740490C6-77EE-4AC0-9561-5EBAACE3A0A7 } \ ", \" success\ ": true }]}"
I created the following classes to hold the object once I deserialize it : @codeSnippetRemoved
but when I run the code the addResult object contains the default object values not the json object values.
The api for this particular response is here : http://help.arcgis.com/en/arcgisserver/10.0/apis/rest/fsadd.html
any help on getting this to work is greatly appreciated
change @codeSnippetRemoved
to @codeSnippetRemoved
Try this @codeSnippetRemoved
or similary you can try this @codeSnippetRemoved
as you are returning list of AddResult in your json Response.
And Change the content type to application / json
