PHP Script Not Receiving Post Data
I have a php script that is processing a form for me.  However, something is strange (or I'm just a bigger noob than I think). 
The following code at the top of the script: @codeSnippetRemoved
Results in the following "printout" when the form is submitted and form data intercepted by the script: @codeSnippetRemoved
I've only included the post array printout to see if post data is actually being received - which, apparently, it is.  So, why is not passing into my variable so that I can USE it? 
I know I'm just a PHP hack, but I feel like I must be losing it. 
Your code has  $_Post  and should be  $_POST ? 
Try changing  $_Post  to  $_POST  in the lower part of your code; that may be what's causing the problem. 
The manual page on  the HTTP POST data superglobal array  describes it as  $_POST . 
And,  elsewhere : 
Basics      Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.  
Thus it follows that your use of  $_Post  should, in fact, read  $_POST . 
You should fix your  error_reporting  settings, because you should have seen an  E_NOTICE  about using a non-existent variable.
