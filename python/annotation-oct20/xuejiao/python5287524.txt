I got this error.. 
Traceback (most recent call last):   File "chomp.py", line 110, in             class Wall(Immovable):   File "chomp.py", line 124, in Wall      for neighbor in neighbors: NameError: name '  
neighbors' is not defined 
I spent lot of time still can't find what's wrong, need some help 
You never close the function call to  Circle()  two lines about line 122, that's probably it. You're probably missing an argument based on the trailing comma. @codeSnippetRemoved
Circle(self.screen_point, dot_size, 
missing something at the end of that line
