Android App Restart
I am developing a Timer based app. Timer runs continuously in one of the activity whether the app is in the foreground or background. A separate service is written to log GPS every one second using a separate timer. Activity timer is responsible for starting and stopping the service based on certain condition.  I have extended the Application class and overridden  the onCreate and onTerminate events. @codeSnippetRemoved
and AndroidManifest.xml @codeSnippetRemoved
service @codeSnippetRemoved
When the app is running in background and sometimes in foreground, the onCreate is executed several times and if the service is running it also gets restarted. 
What could be the reason of frequent restart of the app and firing of onCreate of MyApplication class. What is the solution of this problem?  
Please help me since I am trying solve this problem for last 3 days 
This is the complete androidmanifest file @codeSnippetRemoved
