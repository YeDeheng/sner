what	O
are	O
the	O
main	O
differences	O
between	O
jquery	B-Fram
'	O
s	O
official	O
templating	O
plugin	O
and	O
ICanHaz.js	B-API
?	O

So	O
far	O
I've	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
good	O
things	O
to	O
say	O
about	O
the	O
jQuery	B-Fram
plugin	O
.	O

It	O
'	O
s	O
been	O
easy	O
to	O
use	O
and	O
has	O
done	O
what	O
I	O
need	O
,	O
and	O
while	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
formulate	O
an	O
answer	O
I'd	O
like	O
to	O
hear	O
from	O
naysayers	O
and	O
users	O
of	O
other	O
comparable	O
templating	O
engines	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
might	O
get	O
annoyed	O
with	O
further	O
down	O
the	O
track	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
using	O
the	O
official	O
jQuery	B-Fram
templating	O
plugin	O
and	O
have	O
loved	O
it	O
.	O

Their	O
feature	O
sets	O
currently	O
look	O
pretty	O
comparable	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
since	O
ICanHaz	O
is	O
open-source	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
for	O
more	O
features	O
down	O
the	O
road	O
it	O
might	O
develop	O
faster	O
than	O
the	O
official	O
jQuery	B-Fram
template	O
engine	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
stability	O
the	O
official	O
templating	O
engine	O
would	O
likely	O
be	O
the	O
better	O
choice	O
.	O

Just	O
my	O
2	O
cents	O
