I	O

later	O
I	O
check	O

All	O

I	O

the	O

I	O

I	O
later	O
found	O
the	O
offending	O
polygon	O
(	O
see	O

has	O
been	O
drawn	O
pretty	O
badly	O

I	O

this	O

So	O
my	O

Am	O
I	O
using	O
MakeValid	B-API
correctly	O
?	O

I	O
thought	O
MakeValid()	B-API
would	O
resolve	O
this	O
kind	O

thing	O

Obviously	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
control	O
over	O
the	O
drawing	O
skills	O

my	O
client	O
so	O
if	O
MakeValid	B-API

help	O
for	O
badly	O

is	O
there	O
some	O
other	O
way	O

...	O
making	O
this	O

?	O

Many	O
thanks	O

OK	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
issue	O
was	O
indeed	O
an	O
invalid	O
polygon	O
zone	O
held	O
in	O
the	O
database	O

The	O
'	O
Use	O
MakeValid	B-API
'	O
in	O
the	O
error	O
message	O
triggered	O
some	O
wrong	O
assumptions	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
already	O
using	O
MakeValid	B-API

Actually	O
this	O
error	O
was	O
triggered	O
from	O
an	O
invalid	O
Polygon	O

and	O
not	O
the	O
PolyLine	B-API
I	O
was	O
using	O
in	O
the	O
query	O

To	O
protect	O
against	O
this	O
I	O
have	O
added	O
'	O
MakeValid()	B-API
'	O
to	O
the	O
INSERT	O

so	O
that	O
no	O

I	O

without	O
