Dividing a list into two lists
Below is my current training_list; @codeSnippetRemoved
I need to divide the list into two lists based on the last attribute '  =50K' or ' >50K' I want to exclude the last attribute as well from both lists. I tried the below code and i'm getting the following: @codeSnippetRemoved
Code is as follows; @codeSnippetRemoved
Any help greatly appreciated. 
You're using  lstrip() .   lstrip()  will remove leading whitespace.   The string  "  =50K"  has leading whitespace.  
So we might try to compare against a string that has no leading whitespace: @codeSnippetRemoved
Or perhaps: @codeSnippetRemoved
My solution is : @codeSnippetRemoved
And the output is : @codeSnippetRemoved
if you want optimization: one for can do that @codeSnippetRemoved
using itertools.groupby: @codeSnippetRemoved
