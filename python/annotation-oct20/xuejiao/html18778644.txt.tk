JSColor Not Working on Volusion Option Text Boxes
I'm using the JSColor plugin ( http://jscolor.com ) which I've used successfully in the past but on the e-commerce platform Volusion , there are some issues with getting it to load correctly .
I'm working on a test product .
And you'll notice that I have an input working successfully on the left side of the site but the actual text box in the options field is not working correctly . I believe with Volusion , that the option text boxes don't load until the very end so I've always had to use $ ( window ) .load ( function() {} ); on those rather than just standard jQuery . The working text box is just put in as HTML code and is not part of the Volusion backend .
I've tried a couple things to trigger it . I first set it up like regular and then I tried this . I removed the script declaration in the code and then put it on the page after adding the class name ' color ' ( which is required for this script ) figuring that it would look for anything with class name color but that didn't work . Here ' s what I tried anyway : @codeSnippetRemoved
I can confirm that the script was added successfully to the source code but it doesn't seem to work when I do that .
Any ideas on how to change the order of the elements loading to get this to work ?
I think you are trying to load the JS file @codeSnippetRemoved
on window.load event , Instead of loading at runtime or appending JS location at runtime , you can specify this in theme for all pages , this may add JS without using it on all pages but it should resolve the issue which you have mentioned in your post .
Also I can see textbox name is @codeSnippetRemoved
and you have written it as @codeSnippetRemoved
Try above two options and see if your problem resolved .
