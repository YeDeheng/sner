multiple mousehover with jquery ?
Let ' s say I have a div with a backgroundimage ( my logo ) and I need this div to be switched with other 4 divs which are the same image but with other colours . Each image will be called on a mousehover using a jquery effect so it shows up smoothly , the order will be div1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and then restarts .
An easier explanation would be .. a logo that has 5 diferent colored background and each background color will be shown when you pass your mouse over the logo , like if you pass it the first time it'll be green but if u pass your mouse over the logo again it will be blue and so on .
Now as a completely newbie on javascript and jquery ... how can I achieve this ? can someone guide me trough some tutorial or specific article or maybe give me a snip if code to start with?I've tried to ask this before and someone answered with a snip of code that would be a variable ( a counter to be exactly ) but I didn't really understand how it worked and how to implement it ...
Something along these lines : @codeSnippetRemoved
Initialize an array , setting its elements tothe string prefixes of the variouslogo image files . Initialize a counter to zero , so wedon't have to do any math to use itas an array offset . When the mouse moves over the logoimage , change the image ' s source tothe string stored at colours[colIndex ] . In my example Ihave concatenated the last part ofthe filename , assuming the convention [ colour name]- logo.jpeg . You couldjust as well put the entire filenamein the array and not follow any convention .
I believe that your desire is a bit more complicated than the other answer posted meets -- you want the images to fade smoothly . This code creates a div within a div , and then , on mouseover , shows the internal ( and therefore topmost ) div , changes the background of the lower ( outermost ) div to the next one in the cycle , and then fades out the upper image . It also has a selective lockout mechanism , so if the user goes crazy with the mouse , it won't make the image flicker in an ugly way . I hope this helps , and if you want a deeper explanation of the code ' s functionality ( you should be able to read it , mostly ) post so in the comments .
This code has thee parts .

You could simply make your logo a gif / png with transparency and set it as the background and then animate the backgroundColour css attribute between these values ( building off the previous script ): @codeSnippetRemoved
