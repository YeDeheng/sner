I'm	O
using	O
the	O
JSColor	O
plugin	O
(	O
http://jscolor.com	O
)	O
which	O
I've	O
used	O
successfully	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
e-commerce	O
platform	O
Volusion	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
issues	O
with	O
getting	O
it	O
to	O
load	O
correctly	O
.	O

I'm	O
working	O
on	O
a	O
test	O
product	O
.	O

And	O
you'll	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
an	O
input	O
working	O
successfully	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
site	O
but	O
the	O
actual	O
text	O
box	O
in	O
the	O
options	O
field	O
is	O
not	O
working	O
correctly	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
with	O
Volusion	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
option	O
text	O
boxes	O
don't	O
load	O
until	O
the	O
very	O
end	O
so	O
I've	O
always	O
had	O
to	O
use	O
$	O
(	O
window	O
)	O
.load	O
(	O
function()	B-API
{}	O
);	O
on	O
those	O
rather	O
than	O
just	O
standard	O
jQuery	B-Fram
.	O

The	O
working	O
text	O
box	O
is	O
just	O
put	O
in	O
as	O
HTML	B-PL
code	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Volusion	O
backend	O
.	O

I've	O
tried	O
a	O
couple	O
things	O
to	O
trigger	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
first	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
like	O
regular	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
tried	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
removed	O
the	O
script	O
declaration	O
in	O
the	O
code	O
and	O
then	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
page	O
after	O
adding	O
the	O
class	O
name	O
'	O
color	O
'	O
(	O
which	O
is	O
required	O
for	O
this	O
script	O
)	O
figuring	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
look	O
for	O
anything	O
with	O
class	O
name	O
color	O
but	O
that	O
didn't	O
work	O
.	O

Here	O
'	O
s	O
what	O
I	O
tried	O
anyway	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

I	O
can	O
confirm	O
that	O
the	O
script	O
was	O
added	O
successfully	O
to	O
the	O
source	O
code	O
but	O
it	O
doesn't	O
seem	O
to	O
work	O
when	O
I	O
do	O
that	O
.	O

Any	O
ideas	O
on	O
how	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
the	O
elements	O
loading	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
to	O
work	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
you	O
are	O
trying	O
to	O
load	O
the	O
JS	O
file	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

on	O
window.load	B-API
event	O
,	O
Instead	O
of	O
loading	O
at	O
runtime	O
or	O
appending	O
JS	O
location	O
at	O
runtime	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
specify	O
this	O
in	O
theme	O
for	O
all	O
pages	O
,	O
this	O
may	O
add	O
JS	O
without	O
using	O
it	O
on	O
all	O
pages	O
but	O
it	O
should	O
resolve	O
the	O
issue	O
which	O
you	O
have	O
mentioned	O
in	O
your	O
post	O

Also	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
textbox	O
name	O
is	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

and	O
you	O
have	O
written	O
it	O
as	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

Try	O
