Pass data to imported Python program
What I want to do is something like this: 
Script1: @codeSnippetRemoved
Script2: @codeSnippetRemoved
So I want to be able to run script2.py inside script1.py with variables set in script1.py. I don't think I have explained myself very clearly. Ask me if something is unclear. 
If user must be an object attribute, you can override the init method for the class (its constructor) and pass it the value you need it to store. @codeSnippetRemoved
If, instead, it must be some static value that you share among all the instances of User, either you monkey-patch it as you did, or you define a setter method @codeSnippetRemoved
but I guess the first way makes more sense.Are we missing something from your requirements?
