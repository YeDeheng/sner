Dividing a list into two lists
Below is my current training_list ; @codeSnippetRemoved
I need to divide the list into two lists based on the last attribute ' =50K ' or ' > 50K ' I want to exclude the last attribute as well from both lists.
I tried the below code and i'm getting the following : @codeSnippetRemoved
Code is as follows ; @codeSnippetRemoved
Any help greatly appreciated.
You're using lstrip().
lstrip() will remove leading whitespace.
The string "=50K" has leading whitespace.
So we might try to compare against a string that has no leading whitespace : @codeSnippetRemoved
Or perhaps : @codeSnippetRemoved
My solution is : @codeSnippetRemoved
And the output is : @codeSnippetRemoved
if you want optimization : one for can do that @codeSnippetRemoved
using itertools.groupby : @codeSnippetRemoved
