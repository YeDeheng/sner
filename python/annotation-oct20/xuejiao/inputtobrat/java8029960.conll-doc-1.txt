Read pictures from webcam in Java on Ubuntu?
There are many questions on SO on how to read images from webcams in Java, but judging by the answers there does not seem to be a library which is actively developed and maintained.
My question is if it would make any difference if I limited the OS to Linux only?
I know there ' s a device representing video, / dev / video0, can that be used for reading image data from a webcam using java.io somehow?
Thanks in advance!
You could run a command (external program, started from your Java code) which is handling the video reading of the webcam.
But what do you want to do with the video stream?
EDIT : If you want to do something with the image, get opencv and its bindings, http://ubaa.net/shared/processing/opencv
The page also has a link for Java example programs.
OLD_ANSWER :
You can use vlc, it has webcam support.
As far a Java is concerned, take a look the VLCJ project for the bindings. http://code.google.com/p/vlcj
For the OS bit of your question, on Linux webcam is implemented via v4l (video for linux), but as far as I think, it won't be an issue for having it cross platform.
