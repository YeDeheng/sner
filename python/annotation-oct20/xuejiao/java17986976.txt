How can set location for my swt file dialog?
I have an application where i want to display swt file dialog but in defined location(i want it display somewhere down).I am not getting any method for that.Any help on this is appreciated... 
Isn't   FileDialog#setFilterPath()   what you are looking for?: 
Sets the directory path that the dialog will use to the argument, which may be null.  File names in this path will appear in the dialog , filtered according to the filter extensions. If the string is null, then the operating system's default filter path will be used.   
Currently the API doesn't support to set the location of the  FileDialog .But there is a little hack/workaround for that. 
All you need is to create an invisible  Shell  and set the location. The  FileDialog  decides its location based on the parent.  
It seems a bit complex to know the exact coordinates to  setLocation  on  Shell  but, I leave it to you to do some Permutations and Combinations to know them. 
Here is the code which solves your problem @codeSnippetRemoved
When showing the  FileDialog  on top of a shell, you may open the file dialog, then get the parent shell's sub-shells ( shell.getShells() ) to find out the file dialog's shell. Now you should be able to change its location.
