I	O

not	O

to	O
stop	O
my	O
own	O
service	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
service	O
that	O
places	O
a	O
red	O
rectangle	O
on	O
the	O
screen	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
onDestroy()	B-API
that	O
looks	O
like	O
this	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

from	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
activities	O
i	O
am	O
calling	O
to	O
kill	O
this	O
service	O
like	O
so	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

i	O
see	O
the	O
toast	O
come	O
up	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
onDestroy()	B-API
has	O
been	O
called	O
but	O
i	O
still	O
see	O
the	O
red	O
rectangle	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
running	O

my	O
manifest	O
is	O

Firstly	O
you	O
don't	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
permission	O
to	O
stop	O
a	O
service	O
that	O
you	O
create	O
.	O

I	O
use	O
services	O
frequently	O
(	O
starting	O
and	O
stopping	O
)	O
and	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
I	O
don't	O
ever	O
use	O
that	O
permission	O
.	O

ie	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

is	O
all	O
you	O
need	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O
your	O
service	O
does	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
declared	O
in	O
your	O
Android	B-Plat
Manifest	O
.	O

Now	O
anything	O
that	O
affects	O
your	O
activity	O
uses	O
the	O
context	O
inside	O
that	O
activity	O
.	O

So	O
killing	O
your	O
service	O
won't	O
change	O
what	O
'	O
s	O
on	O
the	O
UI	O
.	O

In	O
your	O
services	O
on	O
Destroy	O
,	O
you	O
should	O
need	O
to	O
somehow	O
reference	O
the	O
rectangle	O
object	O
and	O
remove	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
how	O
you	O
created	O
the	O
rectangle	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
view	O
,	O
you	O
could	O
set	O
it	O
to	O
VISIBILITY.GONE	B-API
,	O
or	O
if	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
a	O
ViewStub	B-API
,	O
you	O
can	O
deflate	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
an	O
object	O
you	O
can	O
clear	O
it	O
,	O
etc	O
..	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
saying	O
your	O
service	O
is	O
still	O
running	O
even	O
after	O
you	O
call	O
the	O
stop	O
service	O
function	O
,	O
then	O
something	O
else	O
is	O
wrong	O
.	O

Even	O
though	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
stopping	O
the	O
service	O
correctly	O
.	O

EDIT	O

Your	O
service	O
might	O
also	O
be	O
bound	O
to	O
your	O
activity	O
too	O

If	O
you	O

this	O

you	O
