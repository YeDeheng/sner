How to get the echoed element in Jquery ?
I've a php file that echoes an img element from a PHP file with id= " uploadedPhoto " .After uploading it i have a Jquery script that changes the size of the image on button click . Before this it was working when i was using img as background of a div however now it isn't working .
HTML Code . @codeSnippetRemoved
img is uploaded in between id= " imageDiv " .
PHP Code . @codeSnippetRemoved
JScript . @codeSnippetRemoved
Can you please find the problem ?
There is issue with DOM structure . I guess your image automatically uses the size of div tag
you use to expand or reduce the size .
So i recommend you to try , fix the size of this div .
