Why using import BaseHTTPServer in Python ?
This is the code I got from Tutorial of how to make local server by using python script to run in Terminal @codeSnippetRemoved
I wonder why they have to import the BaseHTTPServer ? can anyone explain me about that ? below is the version from Python.org @codeSnippetRemoved
You'll see that there is no import BaseHTTPServer , can anyone explain to me why ?
and these code are in Python 2.7 if I want to change it into python 3 Do I still need to import BaseHTTPServer ?
Importing it has has meaningful impact , as you have discovered . As for why it is there - who knows ? Maybe the author of the tutorial intended to use it later in the tutorial , or maybe it was adapted from a larger sample . The point is if nothing is referencing it , you don't need to import it .
The same applies to python 3 .
