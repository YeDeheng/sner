Google map route direction show by arrows in android v2
I am trying to implement google map markers in android google v2. 
i can show markers in the map too using json parsing, but the problem im facing is: 
1: the parsing just tells u-turn but it doesn't tell left u-turn or right so even if im am using some images for showing its a u-turn i don't know which way the u-turn should be. 
2:Is it possible to draw or show an arrowhead over the polyline in map v2 as u can see in the below image 
so any tutorial or example how to do this.. 
thanks 
IF this is your only problem: 
the parsing just tells u-turn but it doesn't tell left u-turn or  right so even if im am using some images for showing its a u-turn i  don't know which way the u-turn should be.  
Then you can easily find out the direction - your route is built from "points" A -> B -> C -> D ... having coordinates of A   B you have  vector . And you can also have vector using B   C. No you just need to  calculate angle between these two vectors  and you will know which direction it goes.
