PHP mysqli query returns empty error message
I have a username input field on my website. When a name is entered, I call the code underneath with ajax.  Unfortunatley the 'or die' executes every time and its output is not helping :  
An error occured(1):  
Why is mysqli_error() empty? If I replace ' or die ' with or ' trigger_error ' it echoes the username only. The db_connex is working everywhere else. I dumbed it down quite a bit in order to find the error. @codeSnippetRemoved
Many thanks in advance!  
I included this script in my index.php and took that one as origin for my path. But this php file is living in my php folder. This led to some weird behaviour.  So my path is wrong...  Oh my god.  This took me 2 hours. Nontheless i am so happy,that i can move on now :)  Thank you so much, Fred!
