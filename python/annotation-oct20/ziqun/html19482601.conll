Have	O
iframe	O
load	O
when	O
visible	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
page	O
with	O
about	O
100	O
videos	O
on	O
them	O
(	O
youtube	O
)	O
loading	O
an	O
iframe	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
all	O
in	O
an	O
accordion	O
style	O
menu	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
wondering	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
load	O
when	O
the	O
accordion	O
is	O
open	O
or	O
the	O
iframe	O
is	O
visible	O
on	O
the	O
page	O
.	O

Right	O
now	O
it	O
takes	O
up	O
way	O
too	O
much	O
memory	O
and	O
lags	O
the	O
page	O
a	O
lot	O
.	O

IF	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
set	O
the	O
src	O
property	O
of	O
the	O
iframe	O
,	O
that	O
points	O
to	O
the	O
videos	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
event	O
that	O
is	O
triggered	O
when	O
the	O
accordion	O
is	O
opened	O
.	O

I	O
haven't	O
worked	O
in	O
a	O
while	O
with	O
the	O
accordion	O
,	O
but	O
pretty	O
sure	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
init	O
event	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

You	O
haven't	O
shown	O
any	O
code	O
that	O
allows	O
us	O
to	O
include	O
this	O
in	O
your	O
code	O
.	O

Don't	O
set	O
the	O
src	O
of	O
the	O
video	O
,	O
store	O
it	O
in	O
data	O
