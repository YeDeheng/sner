Can I use Zend Dom Query to query other html attributes such as ALT
Using Zend Dom Query I would like to search  HTML  to find  certain attributes.  
Take the following image as an example. @codeSnippetRemoved
Instead of using  $this- _xhtml- query('img#active-main-image');  I would like to find the image by using the  alt  attribute. 
Pseudo ->   $this- _xhtml- query('img alt Image 1234');  
I can see why this method is not conventionally popular however, when equipped with nothing but the  Alt value  of a certain image on a page, I see no alternative.  
Thanks 
Zend_Dom_Query  has a  queryXpath  method that will accept valid xpath queries. 
Untested but this should work : @codeSnippetRemoved
