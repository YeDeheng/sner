Using SetForegroundWindow to focus on a window
var hwnd = GetWindowHandle() ; // Custom function that returns the target window ' s handle var currentThreadId = GetCurrentThreadId() ; uint pid ; var targetThreadId = GetWindowThreadProcessId ( hwnd , out pid ); if ( targetThreadId == IntPtr.Zero ) return ; if ( targetThreadId ! = currentThreadId ) { AttachThreadInput ( currentThreadId , targetThreadId , true ); } SetForegroundWindow ( hwnd ); if ( currentThreadId ! = targetThreadId ) { AttachThreadInput ( currentThreadId , targetThreadId , false ); }
I have used the above code to put focus to another window , using the Handle of the targeted window . The above code is placed inside a method which is called when a shortcut key is pressed.The issue that I am facing is that for the first time focus is getting stuck at the window , i.e. , the focus is not shifting to other controls in the window ( on tab press ) . So I have to bring the focus inside the window , using mouse . On pressing the shortcut for the 2nd time , the focus is not getting stuck anymore , its moving correctly on tab press.Also please note that I have tried using SetFocus , but I am getting the same issue .
Please suggest of there is anything wrong with the code , or if I can use any alternate method to achieve the same behavior . Thanks .
