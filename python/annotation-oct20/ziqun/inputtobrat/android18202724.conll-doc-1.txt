Google map route direction show by arrows in android v2
I am trying to implement google map markers in android google v2.
i can show markers in the map too using json parsing, but the problem im facing is :
1 : the parsing just tells u-turn but it doesn't tell left u-turn or right so even if im am using some images for showing its a u-turn i don't know which way the u-turn should be.
2 : Is it possible to draw or show an arrowhead over the polyline in map v2 as u can see in the below image
so any tutorial or example how to do this ..
thanks
IF this is your only problem :
the parsing just tells u-turn but it doesn't tell left u-turn or right so even if im am using some images for showing its a u-turn i don't know which way the u-turn should be.
Then you can easily find out the direction - your route is built from "points" A -> B -> C -> D ... having coordinates of A B you have vector.
And you can also have vector using B C.
No you just need to calculate angle between these two vectors and you will know which direction it goes.
