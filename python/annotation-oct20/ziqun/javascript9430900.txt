Getting input box values into an array in Javascript/HTML
I'm learning Javascript for a project. I'm trying to try and get values from an dynamic number of text inputs into a multi-dimensional array. I have tried this with 1 text field and it correctly saves into the array for further manipulation later. However when i added an second text field and another dimension to the array, it broke. Eventually i will have a drop down list to give the number of inputs once i figure it out. Here's my current code, not very efficient really.  @codeSnippetRemoved

Btw, you have to insert ";" between function calls, not "," 
onclick="insert(this.form.name.value); insert2(this.form.name2.value);  
You need to close all the  td  elements.    As  arunes  mentioned, modify the onclick call with ';' seperator.    As mentioned in my comment, close  html  tag    Not sure why you are using 2-d array, what you want can be done with 1-d array.    
Here's the modified code, just go through-

Its better to make a single function to insert into array rather than 2 seperate functions.  
In case you didn't figured it out yet here is the code: @codeSnippetRemoved
