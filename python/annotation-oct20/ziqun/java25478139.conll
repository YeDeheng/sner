Game	O
Jump	O
in	O
Java	B-PL

So	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
rectangle	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
jumping	O
motion	O
every	O
time	O
I	O
hit	O
the	O
space	O
bar	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
tap	O
the	O
space	O
bar	O
the	O
motion	O
is	O
fine	O
.	O

It	O
goes	O
up	O
and	O
comes	O
back	O
down	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
motion	O
isn't	O
very	O
fluid	O
.	O

It	O
just	O
immediately	O
comes	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
high	O
point	O
and	O
then	O
immediately	O
goes	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

How	O
do	O
I	O
fix	O
this	O
?	O

Here	O
is	O
the	O
code	O
for	O
the	O
jumping	O
motion	O
(	O
Jump	O
is	O
what	O
is	O
called	O
upon	O
pressing	O
the	O
space	O
key	O
and	O
Fall	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
the	O
space	O
key	O
)	O

I'm	O
guessing	O
that	O
actionPerformed()	B-API
is	O
getting	O
called	O
by	O
some	O
clock	O
?	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
within	O
actionPerformed	O
,	O
you've	O
added	O
your	O
own	O
while	O
loop	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
actionPerformed	O
only	O
gets	O
called	O
X	O
times	O
per	O
second	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
loop	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
update	O
your	O
variables	O
(	O
time	O
,	O
py	O
,	O
etc	O
.	O
)	O
and	O
repaint	O
the	O
screen	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
it	O
can	O
.	O

I	O
can't	O
really	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
correct	O
code	O
without	O
understanding	O
the	O
interface	O
you're	O
using	O
(	O
i.e.	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
where	O
"	O
time	O
"	O
and	O
"	O
py	O
"	O
come	O
from	O
)	O
,	O
but	O
maybe	O
try	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
