Have iframe load when visible
I have a page with about 100 videos on them (youtube) loading an iframe. They are all in an accordion style menu, I was wondering if there was a way to have them load when the accordion is open or the iframe is visible on the page. Right now it takes up way too much memory and lags the page a lot.  
IF you want to do this, you can set the src property of the iframe, that points to the videos, on the event that is triggered when the accordion is opened. I haven't worked in a while with the accordion, but pretty sure there is a init event for it. 
You haven't shown any code that allows us to include this in your code. 
Don't set the src of the video, store it in data @codeSnippetRemoved
Using whatever triggers the accordion, $(this) being that accordion item @codeSnippetRemoved
Okay so it will go as follow:   
HTML   @codeSnippetRemoved
javascript   @codeSnippetRemoved
Example:   AccordionLoadFrame
