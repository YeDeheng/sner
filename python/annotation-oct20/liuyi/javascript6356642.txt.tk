Textareas can only contain text .
Textareas can only contain text , but you can overlap elements . Here is an example : http://jsfiddle.net/2qMb3/1
This uses a styled div instead of an image , but you can easily use an image instead of the div .
As other said TextArea only contains Text but , you can try something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
Here is a working example ; you have to manipulate it according to your requirements .
You might want to look into using a WYSIWYG editor such as TinyMCE or CKEditor .
You can use jQuery to add simple CSS to the textarea on click
The HTML @codeSnippetRemoved
The CSS : @codeSnippetRemoved
The Javascript : @codeSnippetRemoved
See it in action : http://jsfiddle.net/gksTQ
