You are trying to read physical  File  as a classpath  Resource , which is  wrong  @codeSnippetRemoved
Change it to @codeSnippetRemoved
String xml = IOUtils.toString(in);  
Here InputStream  in  is null so it raise  NullPointerException .  
Class#getResourceAsStream(String name)  it use to load resource from classpath and normally use in web-based project, and an absolute resource name is constructed from the given resource name using this algorithm: 
If the name begins with a '/' ('\u002f'), then the absolute name ofthe resource is the portion of the name following the '/'.  Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form:modified_package_name/name  
As  Documentation   
As your file exists in local hard-drive( D:\\sample.xml ) better use  FileInputStream  to load the resouce. @codeSnippetRemoved
