How can I use an installer variable on the same screen it's input on
How can I get the the information that's entered into a screen while still on the same screen? For example, suppose I've got a text field that sets a variable called  myVar  and a button  on the same screen  that needs the value of  myVar  to work. 
Two possibilities: 
1) Your button action script can persist the input on all form components as its first action. To do that call @codeSnippetRemoved
Then context.getVariable("myVar") will return the value that is entered on the same screen. 
2) You directly access the form component in the action script of the button: @codeSnippetRemoved
