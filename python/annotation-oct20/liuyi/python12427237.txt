is there a light(er) weight framework for ruby, like web.py for python?
I've recently been seeing more and more about lighter and lighter weight web frameworks - mainly for python (flask, web.py) . 
I'm just curious if there's anything similar for ruby. I haven't found anything in my travels yet but maybe i'm not travelling in the right places. 
You should use  Sinatra  if you want a light weight ruby web framework. 
Check out  Grape  if you're looking to build a  REST-like API .  Here's  a nice primer. 
Camping  is good, despite being slightly... special.   Ramaze  can be  very  lightweight. Oh, and I should add that depending on your definition of lightweight, you  can  build  lightweight apps in Rails .
