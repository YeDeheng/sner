Auto complete based on value of two input textboxes
What I'm trying is view only the records in autocomplete depending on the selected value of dropdownlist. I have here two textboxes, #maincopy is copy the selected value of dropdownlist and the other is textbox for autocomplete. But this isn't working. Any help will appreciate.  @codeSnippetRemoved
