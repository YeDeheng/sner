Trouble with web.xml url pattern
In my web.xml I have URL pattern for servlet like this :
url-pattern / * / myservice / url-pattern
So I want to call it using blablabla / myservice also as anyWord / myservice.
But it doesn't work.
It work only if I call it using this URL : / * / myservice (with asterisk in URL).
You can't do that.According to the Servlet 2.5 Specification (and things aren't that different in other levels of the specification), chapter SRV.11.2 :
A string beginning with a / character and ending with a / * suffixis used for path mapping.
A string beginning with a *. prefix is used as an extension mapping.
A string containing only the / character indicates the "default" servlet of the application.
In this case the servlet path is the request URI minus the context path andthe path info is null.
All other strings are used for exact matches only.
Your case falls under the 4th bullet, so exact mapping is used.
To circumvent that, use a mapping of / (third case).
Map all requests to go to a particular servlet, and have that servlet re-route requests to handlers of some sort (either other servlets, or some custom classes).
For example : @codeSnippetRemoved
And then, within MyServlet ' s code, inspect the URL that you received in the request (using request.getPathInfo()) and use the value to forward the request to other handlers.
You could use a filter while your url pattern is / * and inside the filter decide which redirection you required.
@codeSnippetRemoved
@codeSnippetRemoved
What about two ULR-mapping sections?
