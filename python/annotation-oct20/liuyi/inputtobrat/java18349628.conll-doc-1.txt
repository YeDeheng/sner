You are trying to read physical File as a classpath Resource, which is wrong @codeSnippetRemoved
Change it to @codeSnippetRemoved
String xml = IOUtils.toString (in );
Here InputStream in is null so it raise NullPointerException.
Class #getResourceAsStream (String name) it use to load resource from classpath and normally use in web-based project, and an absolute resource name is constructed from the given resource name using this algorithm :
If the name begins with a ' / ' (' \u002f '), then the absolute name ofthe resource is the portion of the name following the ' / '.
Otherwise, the absolute name is of the following form : modified_package_name / name
As Documentation
As your file exists in local hard-drive (D: \\ sample.xml) better use FileInputStream to load the resouce.
