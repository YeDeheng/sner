How do i fire the google places autocomplete with dictionary on in android firefox browser?
I've integrated with the google places autocomplete on my website.
However when the dictionary is on in the firefox browser on android phones, the places are only listed when i click one of the suggested words. in a normal text box i would do @codeSnippetRemoved
However, in this case, I don't know what event to fire.
How should i fix this?
Here ' s my code
HTML : @codeSnippetRemoved
Javascript : @codeSnippetRemoved
