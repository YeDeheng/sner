Loading off screen, Ajaxload
Hi,
I have a question on how I would go about to show an Ajaxloader .gif until a page is loaded.
The trick for me is that ; The page currently is built so that the page loads one time, I have a tab system, so it loads everything, and then go between the divs.
Because this site is made so that even users with low bandwidth can enter it, you have to click "Load gallery" for the page to start loading the thumbnails.
So what I'm looking for now is ; How do I display a Ajaxload where the gallery is supposed to be, from when a user clicks on the "load gallery" and until all the thumbnails are loaded?
Thanks in advance, Olsson
Assuming you use jQuery ajax.
You can us ajaxStart (callback) to display the loading .gif ajaxStop (callback) again to hide it.
