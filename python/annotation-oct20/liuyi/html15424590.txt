Restoring input/select elements from within a div after its reloaded via jquery.ajax
I have a div that contains a variable number of inputs (text, hidden) and dropdowns (each may have an ID, a name and/or one or more classes.  
This div reloads from time to time and some new inputs may be added or old ones removed. 
What I'm trying to do is to maintain the values entered or selected before each reload without passing current values to the server.  
This here code almost does what I need except for select fields - not getting their values; once this works I can serialize that array and store it somewhere, then decode, iterate and write the values back. @codeSnippetRemoved
Would appreciate any input or perhaps a more elegant solution to such problem? 
Later edit: Benjamin was kind enough to post a link to jquery serialize() which solved the problem very nice. In case someone else will need a bit of code to restore values saved with that: @codeSnippetRemoved
Forms have a   .serialize   method. This is probably the easiest to store in localStorage in your case. 
The  .serialize()  method creates a text string in standard URL-encoded notation. It operates on a jQuery object representing a set of form elements. The form elements can be of several types.  
(Glad it helped)
