Thank you.. 
I am not very familiar with mysqli since iam still using mysql..but i can still give you my personal approach regarding your question:    @codeSnippetRemoved
Hope this gives you the idea. 
$maxTestimonials = 3;$query = "SELECT * FROM testimonials ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT $maxTestimonials";$results = mysqli_query($databaseConnection, $query);
$count = 0;$testimonialsTemplate = ' div class="testimonial-%d"  p %s /p  /div ';while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($results, MYSQL_ASSOC)){    $count++;    echo sprintf($testimonialsTemplate, $count, $row['column_name_to_display']);}  
I'd also suggest you look into  separation of concerns  and  Model-View-Controller  which will help you to structure your code in a slightly more maintainable (and reusable) fashion.
