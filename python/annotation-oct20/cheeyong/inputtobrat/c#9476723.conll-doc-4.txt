I write the Memory stream, back to context.response.Outputstream ; but the pdf doesnt load, the page ' Failed to load Pdf ' results ; Is there any problem in converting btwn memorystream and Pdf contents, or what may be the issue?
I had the same problem, and it turned out that the cause was not closing the document, and adding the following line of code : @codeSnippetRemoved
should fix the problem.
