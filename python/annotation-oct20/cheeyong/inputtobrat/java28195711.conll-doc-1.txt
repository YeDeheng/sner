JPA navigate unidirectional relationship
I have an unidirectional relationship.
Here i have Employee and Andress entities.
In Employee entity i have the following code : @codeSnippetRemoved
What is the correct way to find the Employee entity when i have only the Adress entity.
Can I only do that via jpql?
You could do it like this if you have, for example, the id of the address @codeSnippetRemoved
Using Hibernate criteria API, it would look like this @codeSnippetRemoved
