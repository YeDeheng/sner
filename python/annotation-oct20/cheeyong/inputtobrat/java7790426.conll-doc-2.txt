You should then use the get ...
- and set ... methods on this Blob.
Here you basically have two options :
Work with a byte-array :
Get hold of a byte [] containing the data through Blob.getBytes Manipulate this byte-array Set it back using Blob.setBytes.
Work with InputStream / OutputStream :
Get hold a an InputStream through Blob.getBinaryStream Manipulate this stream as you see fit Use Blob.setBinaryStream.
An alternative approach is to skip messing with Blob in the first place, and instead use the second approach (with streams) directly through the ResultSet -interface.
With Simple Java JDBC Api, you can get a java.sql.Blob back from a ResultSet.
ResultSet.getBlob (index) or ResultSet.getBlob (String columnName).
Both returns a Blob.
Once you get a Blob, you can get the byte [] back from the Blob.getBytes() method or set using setBytes() method.
Update : Seeing that some Database driver vendors don't support Blob, you can use ResultSet.getBinaryStream().
It depends on which kind of blob contains (image, video) and it ' s extension.
I wrote a simple program to retrieve an image from DB and show it in JSP page.
Hope it helps.
