Unreadable .js file ? How to convert back ?
I have 3 files something.js , something.min.js and something.style.jsThe third is unreadable ( here is in my server where I uploaded ): [ Removed link for good reasons] .I want to convert back the file to normal , or visit as readable strings . And it will be good if I can convert my normal js to this format.Thanks for any help and sorry for my grammatical errors :)
