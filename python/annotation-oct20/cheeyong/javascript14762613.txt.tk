JavaScript insertAt position
Assuming I have a collection with a bunch of well ordered elements , what ' s the common method to insert another new child at it ' s abstract order-position ?
Using a dom library $(new).eq($(new).data('orderPosition ')) ; doesn't work , because it ' s not a valid index . @codeSnippetRemoved
My real collection contains about ~400 elements .
why don't you just store the order-position in an array and then calculate the index using it ? it is far better solution as reading DOM property consumes a lot more CPU than just loop through array and compare your new item with existing ones
I think that working with an array of integers is probably the most efficient method . You can maintain a constant list of the sorted elements in an array somewhere ( and even continue to sort as needed ): @codeSnippetRemoved
