How do I perpetuate private field data from a Component object into an Entity object using NHibernate ?
Lets say we have an Entity class that has many fields and methods but also has a Component object . We have kept Component data encapsulated in a separate class for an arbitrary reason . @codeSnippetRemoved
Lets say our Component has many responsibilities but only 3 fields all of which are private fields . We have kept the fields private for an arbitrary reason . @codeSnippetRemoved
Now , lets say that our Entity corresponds with a Table in the database.We want that table to have a column for each field on the Component.We call them " columnName1 " , " columnName2 " , and " columnName3 " respectively .
The question is : how can we use Fluent NHibernate to perpetuate private field data from a Component object which belongs to an Entity ( that corresponds with a table in your database ) ?
You override the auto mapping for your entity like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
