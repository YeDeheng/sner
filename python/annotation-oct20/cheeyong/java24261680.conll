Currently	O
I	O
have	O
one	O

But	O
since	O
I'm	O

I'd	O

My	O

is	O
that	O
it'll	O
be	O
really	O
hard	O
to	O
use	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
box	O
JTable	O

Therefore	O
I'm	O
looking	O
for	O
any	O
other	O
suitable	O
options	O

My	O

described	O
a	O
possible	O
solution	O

but	O
a	O
big	O
drawback	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
multiple	O
of	O

'	O

are	O
all	O
across	O
my	O

Does	O
anyone	O
have	O
a	O
