Android WebView shows plain text instead of html
First , I am going to say this is only an issue on Android 2 and older ( 4 seems to be unaffected and I didn't test 3 ) .
I have a WebView that loads html from a string . The HTML looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
You can see that css file looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
The WebView code looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
What Happens
I see the html code in the WebView as if I had set the mime type to plain text .
What I'd Expect ( and what happens in Android 4.x
I see the html in the WebView
There are a few things that have to be true to show the symptoms I am seeing :
Android 2.x ( I was using 2.3.7 and 2.2 ) The css has to be accessed via a url href= " http://www.robotsidekick.com/test.css?rev=0 " as opposed to href= " test.css " ( however it doesn't matter if it ' s a real css file href= " http://www.thisisnotarealurl.fake/test.css?rev=0 causes the same problem ) The css must have a get parameter ? rev=0 , but it doesn't matter what it is
Also wanted to note that the following did not make a difference :
Using the appropriate " instead of ' in the HTML Having the link tag close itself or not The contents of the css Adding a doctype ! DOCTYPE html to the HTML
Changing the webview.loadData line to this : @codeSnippetRemoved
Solves this problem . It seems weird to me that a relative path with an unencoded ? doesn't cause problems , while a fake url with an unencoded ? does cause problems .
Also find it odd that the WebView changed enough in subsequent versions of Android that we don't have to go encoding our html anymore ? That sounds fishy .
