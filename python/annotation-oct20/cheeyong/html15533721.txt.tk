How do I use CSS to create rounded corners in IE 8 ?
How do I use CSS to create rounded corners in IE 8 ? Since the CSS rule corner-radius doesn't work is there a solution to create rounded corners in using CSS in IE8 ( or IE6 , and IE7 ) .
After a lot of research , I have found that there is a fix similar to the PNG transparancy fix available to IE6 , called CSS3Pie . The website to the solution is found here : http://css3pie.com
You will simply have to add behavior : url ( path / to / pie_files / PIE.htc ); to your css anywhere you wish to implement rounded corners . @codeSnippetRemoved
