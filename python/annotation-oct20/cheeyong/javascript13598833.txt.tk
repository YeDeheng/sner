tab switch in js , which is faster ?
I always romoving ' current ' class of all siblings then add ' current ' class to my clicked one . I want to know will it be faster only removing ' current ' class of which has ' current ' .seems to be a simple question , but I really want to know .

Yes , filtering the query to a smaller set of elements will perform faster , because there are less elements to check .
In modern browsers , jQuery will use native methods to query the DOM , so adding the selector has a negligible performance impact .
I don't think there ' s much difference , since there ' s only one " current " . It doesn't matters too much for querying one more element or one less .
Usually I'll first find out the outer element to narrow down @codeSnippetRemoved
Depending on how many elements you are re-classing , the impact of the optimization will of course vary .
I tested it , http://jsperf.com/reclassing-all-or-one , using 7 ( seemed reasonable for for example navigation tabs ) divs and I think the difference was significant ( reclassing all 30% slower than only one ) , percentage wise . If one cares about actual time though it may not be , but I can't really see any reason not do be distinct .
