You	O
should	O
place	O
a	O
link	O
to	O
an	O
action	O
which	O
will	O
perform	O
the	O
deletion	O
of	O
the	O
record	O
.	O

@codeSnippetRemoved	O

Than	O
in	O
your	O
recetas_galetas.php	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

There	O
are	O
several	O
ways	O
to	O
archive	O
this	O
,	O
first	O
and	O
and	O
most	O
important	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
a	O
field	O
on	O
your	O
database	O
table	O
where	O
you	O
can	O
identify	O
the	O
record	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
delete	O
,	O
for	O
example	O
a	O
primary	O
key	O
in	O
form	O
of	O
an	O
ID	O
or	O
a	O
unique	O
key	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
this	O
by	O
creating	O
a	O
link	O
with	O
a	O
text	O
to	O
a	O
delete.php	B-API
page	O
or	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
JQuery	B-Fram
and	O
AJAX	B-Stan
or	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
a	O
inner	O
form	O
.	O

You	O
will	O
also	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
only	O
authorized	O
users	O
to	O
use	O
those	O
pages	O
so	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
a	O
login	O
page	O
with	O
session	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
see	O
here	O
an	O
example	O
of	O
login	O
page	O
with	O
sessions	O
.	O

The	O
simplest	O
one	O
is	O
a	O
link	O
to	O
the	O
delete	O
page	O
,	O
see	O
example	O
here	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

Then	O
on	O
your	O
delete	O
page	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

You	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
link	O
that	O
passes	O
the	O
id	O
to	O
another	O
php	B-PL
page	O
which	O
preforms	O
the	O
delete	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
link	O
will	O
be	O
like	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

then	O
in	O
your	O
delete.php	B-API
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
simple	O
way	O
of	O
doing	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
for	O
you	O
.If	O
you	O
didn't	O
verify	O
the	O
user	O
of	O
this	O
page	O
,	O
any	O
one	O
could	O
manipulate	O
this	O
code	O
easily	O
and	O
delete	O
any	O
row	O
of	O
the	O
table	O
.	O

Other	O
ways	O
could	O
be	O
navigating	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
page	O
and	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
process	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
page	O
or	O
you	O
could	O
use	O
ajax	B-Stan
but	O
this	O
is	O
another	O
issue	O
.	O

Hope	O
this	O
helps	O
and	O
excuse	O
my	O
