The value of a range from another page
I want to have a program with range and at the end I want to give the user all the results .
First of all the range
Javascript : @codeSnippetRemoved
HTML @codeSnippetRemoved
The code above is GOOD ( I just write this so you know which variables I use )
You see I give the value of the range each time it change an image . Then my problem , I need to take the results from above and put them in another page so i can put it in a database . I want to show it in that other page in a textarea so the users know what they have scored on the test . @codeSnippetRemoved
I guess I need to write something between textarea but I don't know what . Already tried some things . Yes echo ' s because I do this in the else of " if($_SERVER[REQUEST_METHOD]=='POST ')" .
I really hope someone can help me with this .
You can direct users to the properer page using the switch function : http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.switch.php
When it comes to saving that result to a database , maybe this will help you : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13337807/how-to-pass-javascript-variables-to-a-database
I would say that when you generate the link to the next page , put the post function in that link . Hope that helps .
