paths	O

draw	O
text	O
on	O
merged	O
path	O

In	O
my	O
application	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
merge	O
several	O
short	O
paths	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
larger	O
one	O
.	O

Example	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

This	O
works	O
just	O
fine	O
and	O
draws	O
a	O
neat	O
V-shape	O
to	O
the	O
canvas	O
.	O

However	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
merged	O
path	O
for	O
text	O
rendering	O
(	O
using	O
Canvas.drawTextOnPath()	B-API
)	O
,	O
it	O
only	O
draws	O
text	O
along	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
path	O
(	O
i.e.	O
the	O
original	O
p1	O
)	O
.	O

I'd	O
like	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
entire	O
path	O
for	O
text	O
rendering	O
,	O
though	O
.	O

So	O
is	O
there	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
achieve	O
that	O
?	O

Do	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
use	O
two	O
paths	O
?	O

You	O
can	O
try	O
using	O
one	O
like	O
:	O
@codeSnippetRemoved	O

and	O
then	O
use	O
the	O
the	O
Canvas.drawTextOnPath()	B-API
on	O
p1	O

Hope	O
that	O
helps	O
.	O

Figured	O
this	O
out	O
myself	O

The	O
behavior	O
described	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
known	O
issue	O
.	O

I	O
guess	O
this	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
every	O
path	O
is	O
internally	O
seen	O
as	O
a	O
separate	O
"	O
contour	O
"	O
which	O
cannot	O
be	O
merged	O
with	O
another	O
one	O

However	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
desired	O
behavior	O
with	O
a	O
simple	O
"	O
hack	O
"	O

This	O
only	O
works	O
for	O
line-based	O
paths	O

Here	O

Path.addPath()	B-API

You	O
