Options for linting Cython code
I have a Cython module that I would like to lint PEP8 style , however pylint syntax errors on Cython cdef syntax . Does anyone have a suggestion about how to maintain Python coding standards for Cython code ?
Although not command-line based , PyCharm claims to have Cython support . Unfortunately , it ' s only available on the paid-version " Professional Edition " .
