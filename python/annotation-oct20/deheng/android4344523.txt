try this in your menifest file with Activity that you want to show as pop-up.-->> android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Dialog" 
Add this permission to your manifest: @codeSnippetRemoved
First of all thanks to  Mathias Lin  
I am new to Android so it was hard to me to set permission knowing from  Mathias Lin 's answer.Because I didn't know how to set permission and where in the manifest file. 
Finally I did it by help of  Mathias Lin 's answer. So I made the answer elaborate. 
In mainfest file use @codeSnippetRemoved
after  @codeSnippetRemoved
as @codeSnippetRemoved
