SKShapeNode equivalent in Cocos2D/SpriteBuilder
I have worked on different business Apps for iOS and Android before. Now I am working on my fist small game. I made some tests with SpriteKit and it worked quite well. To be able to port the game to Android I am now testing Cocos2D and SpriteKit. It works quite well to, but there is one thing I could not solve yet: 
The game is for kids and one taks is to find a path trough a labyrinth. This done by connecting a series of dots with a line.  
In SpriteKit I uses SKShapeNodes to create the dots and the path between them. This was quite easy: @codeSnippetRemoved
How can I do the same in Cocos2D/SpriteBuilder? I found  CCDrawNode  but according to the docs this is made for debug use and not indented for "real" projects.  
What is the right way to do this in Cocos2D?
