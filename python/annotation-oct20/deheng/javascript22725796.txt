My JavaScript loop is an infinite loop?
I'm new to programming, so please don't be harsh with my skills. Anyways, here is my code, I'm attempting to make a simple countdown loop. @codeSnippetRemoved
What did I do wrong? 
Javascript has function-level block execution. One function runs to completion before another function is given ability to execute. Your while loop is maintaining the execution baton, so the other functions in setTimeout are never given a chance. 
although javascript is called asynchonous in this case it does not call the subtract function until the first one is finished. (details  http://ejohn.org/blog/how-javascript-timers-work/ ) 
this should work @codeSnippetRemoved
When using the setTimeout function you actualy call a function after X miliseconds (in this case X=1000, which is 1 second). 
'While' is the function you want to do the countdown with, right? So in your subtract function just write: @codeSnippetRemoved
You can also drop the subtract function and just write: @codeSnippetRemoved
Or drop the while function: @codeSnippetRemoved
setInterval  is the function to set a function to run periodically.  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.setInterval  @codeSnippetRemoved
