PHP send array to another PHP file
This may be a stupid question but I'm lost here . I need to send array with some data in it to another PHP file using POST variable . This is my form : @codeSnippetRemoved
And this is test.php @codeSnippetRemoved
So this is what I tried , but it ' s not displaying anything . please help
You need to create a number of input elements with the same name , each of which will have one array item as its value : @codeSnippetRemoved
Important points to keep in mind :
$item must always be a scalar value ( string , integer , etc ) . You cannot pass in arrays piecemeal with this technique . Never forget that since you are injecting variables into HTML output you must escape and / or sanitize them properly . In this case this is done with htmlspecialchars , which must know about your output encoding to work correctly in general ( look up its third parameter ) .
There is also an alternative approach that can be used to pass arrays piecemeal through serialization : @codeSnippetRemoved
And you would then unserialize it on the receiving end : @codeSnippetRemoved
I ' m mostly including this option for completeness , as in practice session variables are a much better way of passing complex state between requests .
Is it necessary to put the data of the array in a hidden field ? You can store the array in $_SESSION and access it . Btw , I think you have a problem , labels can be submitted , in that case you must put the data into an input field with type= " hidden " .
