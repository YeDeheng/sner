When you call a method you don't specify the types of the arguments. 
Change  @codeSnippetRemoved
to @codeSnippetRemoved
Change this line by removing type of parameter when calling the method: @codeSnippetRemoved
To @codeSnippetRemoved
You have put 
Travelable otherTravelable in the return line of toTime.just return  @codeSnippetRemoved
