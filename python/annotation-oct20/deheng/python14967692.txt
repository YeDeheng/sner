C++: various encodings getters like in Python
My question is about encodings under C++. When I've worked with Python, I've sometimes had to use such encodings for various needs: @codeSnippetRemoved
Now there is a question: is there a cross-platform way to to something like it in C++? I know that I could see Python's sources, but probably there are some solutions  which are famous to people who use C++ and there is no need to see Python's sources. I think that for locale I can use  #include  locale   or  #include  clocale  ; under Linux I can also use  getenv("LANG")  from   cstdlib  . Is there anything else? 
If it can help, I have working  ICU  library.
