How to avoid repeatedly adding the checked value to the input text box
I am working on a project where I want to add the radio button value to the input field.
The input field is to add a name, and radio button is used to select the sex.
By default it should be "My Name" on the input field, and when the user checks the radio button, it should add the text "I am a { radio button value}".
I've managed to do some of this, but the problem is :
When I switch the radio button it keeps on adding the text, and it looks silly.
By default it shows the value "I am a undefined" where it should be "my Name" How can I validate that the user has selected the sex when they submit?

Thanks for the help.
First you execute the function displayVals() ; on dom ready without a radio is selected so the input text get the vaule of undefined.
Second you add the old value everytime on radio change.
Take a look here :
function displayVals() { var a = $("input[type='radio ' ]: checked ") .val() ; var b = "I am a" ; var checkedValue = $ ("p ") .html (" b I am a / b "+" "+ a ); var input = $("input[type='text ' ] ") ; // you want to add only the value of radio each time. input.val(a);}$("input[type='radio ' ] ") .change (displayVals ); // why execute this one on dom ready ??
// displayVals() ; script src= "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js" / script input type= "text" onblur= "this.placeholder = ' my name '" onfocus=" this.placeholder = ''" placeholder= "my name" name= "name" id= "my name" class= "InputText" input type= "submit" value= "Submit" class= "SubmitButton" br input type= "radio" id= "single" name= "sex" value= "Boy" Boy nbsp ; nbsp ; | nbsp ; nbsp ; input type= "radio" id= "single" name= "sex" value= "Girl" Girl br br br br p / p select id= "single" option Single / option option Single2 / option / select

To avoid duplicate result, don't reappend the input.val in it : @codeSnippetRemoved
Check if the value is undefined before filling the input and the p : @codeSnippetRemoved
To validate before submit : @codeSnippetRemoved
I put it on the submit button to show you the behavior but you should put it in the form submit event.
OK, there are several things :
Remove the onblur and onfocus from the input text definition, placeholder already behaves like that.
Remove the call to displayVals() at the end of the script Remove the input.val() + in the reassignation of the input.val For the validation, you may add the keyword required to the definition of either input radio tags, or even both.
