Deleting a file from folder using PHP
I am trying to implement a way for user to delete files.
I am using the code below but it doesn't delete the files.
This file is under the root and i checked and made sure that it has permissions to allow users to do what they want, so i am thinking its the script : @codeSnippetRemoved
unlink ($file) is the correct function to delete a file.
Check if the $fn is filled.
And try to use.
