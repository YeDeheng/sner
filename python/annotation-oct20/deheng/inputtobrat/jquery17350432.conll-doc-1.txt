Form validation while the submit button is triggered via javascript
I have a form that opens in the modal.
I want to implement validation for that.
However, I tried to implement the jQuery form validation but in vain.
The main reason of being not able to trigger the form validation is that the form submit button is triggered using javascript.
While the form submits it doesn't execute the validation part.
What is the work around for this?
here is the form :: @codeSnippetRemoved
And the JavaScript that triggers the form submission.
@codeSnippetRemoved
I also tried jquery form validator but still not showing any errors while submitting the form.
It straight away goes to the database where only null values are updated.
Validation jQuery @codeSnippetRemoved
You must return false ; to stop the default functionality of the click event from happening, like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
and change your onclick : @codeSnippetRemoved
or you could just do this : @codeSnippetRemoved
You had a few things wrong with your code :
Missing, after the pincode validation rules.
This appeared twice.
Inline events (onClick).
jQuery makes it really easy to attach events.
In my code I replaced your inline event on the ' close ' button with : @codeSnippetRemoved
This is easier to read and nicely separates the HTML from your javascript.
Read more about .on() in the documentation.
The validation plugin is triggered when the form is submitted.
Your original code used an ajax request in a separate event handler so the plugin was never called.
You also had your submit button ("save changes ") outside the form tags which is another reason it wouldn't work.
I moved your buttons inside the form and fixed / improved the other areas of your javascript so it now works : http://jsfiddle.net/U2hHH/4 - currently the formatting isn't great but it ' s validating the form correctly.
I've combined your ajax functions into just one in the submitHandler : callback.
The ajax should work but I can't guarantee it so if it doesn't work please check your browser ' s console.
