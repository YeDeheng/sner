check distinct values in datarowview.row.itemarray other than empty string
I am getting datarowview through the following code @codeSnippetRemoved
how can i check here that all values in s.Row.ItemArray is distinct.
If value is null or empty string it should skip the distinct nature ie there can be multiple null values or empty string in ItemArray but no other same values.
you can use LINQ GroupBy to check the distinct : @codeSnippetRemoved
How it works :
To simplify, assume your item array has : [ 1, 1, 3, 3].
GroupBy (x = x) will group your array in two group : @codeSnippetRemoved
To know whether it is distinct or not, you just check whether any group has Count > 1, if yes, it is not distinct.
Example in here is not distinct
