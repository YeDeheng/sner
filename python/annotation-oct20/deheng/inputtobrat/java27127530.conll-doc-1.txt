When you call a method you don't specify the types of the arguments.
Change @codeSnippetRemoved
to @codeSnippetRemoved
Change this line by removing type of parameter when calling the method : @codeSnippetRemoved
To @codeSnippetRemoved
You have put
Travelable otherTravelable in the return line of toTime.just return @codeSnippetRemoved
