JavaScript not working in Internet Explorer
I am having this dynamic dropdown code. Here i want to load the second dropdown options dynamically by changing the first dropdown options. This works fine in all other browsers except IE. I don't know whats the reason as i'm a starter. could any one explain the reason. 
HTML CODE: @codeSnippetRemoved
JS CODE @codeSnippetRemoved
It appears that non-IE browsers (e.g. Chrome) will set the  value  of an   option   tag implicitly using it's inner-text, but IE does not do this. You have two options: 
1) Set the   option   value explicitly @codeSnippetRemoved
Or, 
2) Switch on  text  @codeSnippetRemoved
(Tested in Chrome and IE9.) 
Try the alternative using older method to dynamically add option  
@codeSnippetRemoved
