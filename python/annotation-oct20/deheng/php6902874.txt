Deleting a file from folder using PHP
I am trying to implement a way for user to delete files.  I am using the code below but it doesn't delete the files.  This file is under the root and i checked and made sure that it has permissions to allow users to do what they want, so i am thinking its the script: @codeSnippetRemoved
unlink($file) is the correct function to delete a file. 
Check if the $fn is filled. And try to use. @codeSnippetRemoved
