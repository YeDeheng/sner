Twitter Widget Loading Slowly
Is there something I can do about the Twitter official widget loading slowly?  It pops up as a hyperlink when I first refresh the webpage, and then after a full second or so, the actual widget pops up.  Would I want to load it first or maybe "reserve" the area for the widget so that the entire page doesn't bump down when it opens? @codeSnippetRemoved
Thank you in advance!
