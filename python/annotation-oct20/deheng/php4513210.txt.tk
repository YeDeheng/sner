function / command to retrieve web content ( besides from wget or file_get_contents )
I need to retrieve a web content . I usually use wget but it ' s giving me an " Internal Server Error " this time . I also tried using file_get_contents() , it works when I'm using MAMP installed in my Mac , but when I run it in our server , it ' s not doing anything and prints no error message . Is there any other way to do this ? Below are the code that I used . @codeSnippetRemoved
Thanks in advance !!
I don't know how to reply to all of you so I just added it here . CURL WORKED PERFECTLY . Thanks a lot guys . I just have to ask though why file_get_contents() won't work even if it ' s enabled in the php.ini ?
I would guess that you don't have the fopen wrappers enabled . To test , do : @codeSnippetRemoved
If this returns false ( or 0 , can't remember which ) , you can't use file_get_contents to open a remote file .
If cURL is installed , you can use that to access remote files .
allow_url_fopen may be turned off by your web host . You should see if this can be turned on . If not , cURL may still available so you should try using that instead .
If cURL is available to you , use that . You can determine if cURL is installed by doing a phpinfo() ; . For more information on cURL : PHP : cURL
Please reference http://davidwalsh.name/download-urls-content-php-curl for a solid example of using PHP ' s implementation of CURL to fetch the contents located at a given URL .
I believe you'll find the process fairly straightforward .
You can use cURL : @codeSnippetRemoved
function curl ( $url ) { $ch = curl_init() ; curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_URL , $url ); curl_setopt ( $ch , CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER , 1 ); return curl_exec ( $ch ); curl_close ( $ch ); }
$html = curl ( " http://www4.honolulu.gov/hpdtraffic/MainPrograms/frmMain.asp?sSearch=All+Incidents sSort=I_tTimeCreate ") ;
