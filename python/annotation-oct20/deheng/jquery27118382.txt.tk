How to hide / remove a class base on Bootstrap media query breakpoints ?
I just want to ask if it is possible to show / hide a class based on the screen of the device ? I am using bootstrap default media query . I have this default setup : @codeSnippetRemoved
I have a div that like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
What I want is if the media query is in the col-xs -# the class pull-right will be hide or remove.Is it possible in bootstrap ?
Bootstrap has built-in utility classes for hiding\showing content based on the viewport .
http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities
.visible -xs-* and .hidden -xs ( * = block , inline-block or inline )
EDIT
You won't be able to override .pull -right because it uses ! important , and it only applies one rule ( float : right ; ) , so its pretty easy to recreate as a custom class . @codeSnippetRemoved
Edit #2
If you want to keep with the mobile-first nature of bootstrap , it would look like this .. the sm would indicate it pulls right on sm or larger viewports ( for semantics ) . @codeSnippetRemoved
Hide or remove is not possible , but you can change the way will be rendered
@media only screen and ( max-width : 480px ) { .pull -right { float : none ; }}
So , in this way , in all media screen less then 480px , this class will not be rendered with float : right .
