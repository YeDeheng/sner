How to connect draggable divs
I have some divs that I clone and can drag and drop in a area , now , I want to connect by lines the divs and if I move the divs , this lines must move too . Something like a flow diagram , I clone the divs using drag and drop , but still don't know how to do this lines .
Thanks !
I've thought about this before but I've never had a need to actually try to implement it . Try this :
Create a transparent GIF or PNG that has a diagonal line running from one corner to another . As you drag the divs around , stretch the image so that it ' s corners are always touching each div . You will probably need a diagonal-down image and a diagonal-up image and switch between the two based on the relative positioning of the two divs .
This will probably take some finesse to get it working well , but it is the best thing that I can think of to get diagonal lines in HTML .
take two divs , divA and divB . calculate the shortest distance between the closest borders of the divs determine the middle coordinates of those closest sides of each diveg :
A : { x : 10 , y : 10 }
B : { x : 20 : y : 10 } determine the intersection-point of lines from those points ( C ) C = AX , BY or AY , BX ( depending on divA and divB positions ) create two divs , that represent AC and BC
tip : @codeSnippetRemoved
repaint every time you move the divs with jquery .
note : as you can see , there are always 2 sides close and 2 sides far when the divs are not parallel .
you can use jsplumb library to achieve this . if you have two divs , div1 and div2 , @codeSnippetRemoved
this should establish the connectors . if your divs are movables , then onmove , make a call to jsPlumb.repaint()

Hope this helps . good luck
