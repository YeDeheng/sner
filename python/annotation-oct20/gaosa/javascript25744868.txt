AngularJS use ng-options to create a Set
I have a data-model that looks like the following (there are other fields but these are the most significant): @codeSnippetRemoved
I want to get the following array:  @codeSnippetRemoved
in order to show it in a   select   something like the following: @codeSnippetRemoved
unique isnt convenient since it does exactly the opposite of what I want. 
As mentioned in my comment above, i think you need to create a new scope var with the select options, getting the unique values of the initial object - in whatever iteration you'll be doing, you must have something to compare the values. So, something like that should do it: @codeSnippetRemoved
now you will be using  countryOptions  in the ng-options, to get the unique values @codeSnippetRemoved
Fiddle  
Unless I'm misinterpreting the question you want to filter by unique properties of the objects in your model array.The unique filter does this by passing in the property key: @codeSnippetRemoved
