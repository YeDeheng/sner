How to "append" new field / data into an object without creating a new class nor modifying the class?
I have a method which calculates an integer for every row in a bean MyPeriod.
I don't want to change the class MyPeriod, to create a new class or to have two lists but I need to return some list which contains the list of MyPeriod with a new column.
What is the ways to deal with this issue?

You have listed the good alternatives - creating a new class and changing MyPeriod.
If you want a bad one, you could return an array, and let your callers assume that it has two items : @codeSnippetRemoved
If you know that all periods in List MyPeriod are different, and also that MyPeriod implements robust hashCode() and equals(), you could use LinkedHashMap MyPeriod, Integer to establish your mappings : @codeSnippetRemoved
If you are using JDK7 or later, you can use javafx.util.Pair : @codeSnippetRemoved
public Map MyPeriod, Integer bindNewColumn (List MyPeriod periods) { Map MyPeriod, Integer map = new HashMap MyPeriod, Integer (); for (MyPeriod period : periods) { map.put (period, calculation (period )); } return map ; }
With a Pair.
