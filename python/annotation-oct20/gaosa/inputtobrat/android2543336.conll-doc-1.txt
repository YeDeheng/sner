TabWidget white foreground color?
I don't know what I did but for a period of time my TabWidget had white colored tabs which looked really nice.
I never set a theme or background / foreground color in my project at all.
The next time I compiled it it reverted back to the gray tabs.
My application is using the default dark theme.
Even if I set the application theme to light, the tabs are still gray.
So obviously it was something else that changed the tabs ' color.
Anyone know how to do this?
Check this answer of mine : Background in tab widget ignore scaling
You can also refer to the android.graphics.drawable package
In your code, you can set the background for your tabs like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
I was having a problem due to a bug in Android 1.6 ' s light theme (tab indicator text is white).
I was able to override the default theme as follows :
I created a custom theme that inherited from the default theme :
styles.xml : @codeSnippetRemoved
Then I just apply that theme to my application by adding android : theme= "@style / MyTheme" to the application / element of my AndroidManifest.xml.
in the public void onCreate (Bundle savedInstanceState) @codeSnippetRemoved
than in the listener :
public void onTabChanged (String tabId) { setTabColor() ;
finally the function, which set the foreground and the background too : @codeSnippetRemoved
In onCreated() : @codeSnippetRemoved
