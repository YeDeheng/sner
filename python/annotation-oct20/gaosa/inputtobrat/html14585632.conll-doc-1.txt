Menu jumping down on resize, responsive design, certain browsers only
I'm currently working on this site and I'm having a problem with the top menu navigation in both Safari and Chrome (latest versions).
It works in Firefox, and even in the latest Internet Explorer!
There are four responsive resolutions ; the standard and biggest width, iPad portrait, iPhone landscape and iPhone portrait.
The problem doesn't occur when resizing back and forth on all the resolutions except iPhone portrait.
When resizing up from iPhone portrait the top menu navigation jumps down below the bottom-border of the header.
I've tried looking at my mediaquery for iPhone portrait, and haven't been able to figure out what the issue is.
I hope you can help me with the little info I've given, it was too elaborate to throw all the code into a jsfiddle.
I don't really see why this is happening either, but if you add overflow : hidden to your #main -header, you see what is happening.
There ' s a bit of a float confusion, which was a common problem in IE6 if you had right floated elements after block elements in your HTML ...
if you keep the hidden overflow on the header and add float : left to #logo it works for me, though.
Your header should be handled in diffrent way your inner elements should have inline-block ; header should have inline-block with width : 100% which will be affected by parent widthand it should fix your responsive problem
I dug a bit more around and did some testing with different css options, I found that I actually forgot to put a height on the main-header div, and clear the container-div below it.
I did this and it fixed the problem.
I know some of the code I have on i.e. the navigation isn't done exactly the way it should, but it works now on all the browsers and resolutions and that ' s the important part.
Thanks for leading me in the right direction!
