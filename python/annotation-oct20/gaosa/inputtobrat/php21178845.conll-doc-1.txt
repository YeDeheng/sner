PHP check if a radio button is clicked
I want to know if the user clicks the submit button, it will check if the user checks all radiobuttons.
This is what I've tried so far : @codeSnippetRemoved
CheckQuiz.php @codeSnippetRemoved
Im a newbie so I really need your help.
I want check first if all radio buttons have been checked and then check if the user ' s answers.
Can you give me sample implementations of this?
Your help will truly be appreciated Thanks.
if (isset ($_POST[ "radioBoxName" ] )) { // It was checked echo $_POST[ "radioBoxName" ]; // This is the value of the checked option }
Edit based on comments
If you have lets say 10 questions with 4 different answers for each you can then name your radio boxes like this @codeSnippetRemoved
Then you can check them in PHP like @codeSnippetRemoved
First you have name all your radio buttons with the same name.
Say its name is question. example below @codeSnippetRemoved
Then you can access its value from server as @codeSnippetRemoved
edited as per needed by user
if you have multiple questions then you could use like below @codeSnippetRemoved
Then you could iterate as below : @codeSnippetRemoved
