Iframe header location
I've a problem with iframe.
My first file filtre.html contain iframe with a basic code like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
This file filtre.php is a drop down dynamic list with 3 levels (PHP / MYSQL).
Filtre.php this file is actually a dynamic dropdown 3 levels and will find info in a DB.
The submit sent to a URL and all working fine.
My problem is with iframe.
When I click on submit, target page is found in this part of 220x220 instead of reloading the parent page.
I tried several solutions to no avail.
Here is part of my php file (I deliberately truncated several parts) including the header location and the form : @codeSnippetRemoved
I also tried with javascript but without success.
In this configuration there I removed the line : @codeSnippetRemoved
Here is the javascript code in the header : @codeSnippetRemoved
The problems in this case is that the document load loop.
Anyway, I'm stuck, I thank you in advance for your help.

If I understand what ' s happening, the buttons are targeting the contents of the iframe and loading the page inside that, instead of the actual window?
If that ' s the case, set the target attribute the either _parent or _top and that should target the actual window.
You can try this javascript code :
? php
/ * ------- Your Php Code ----- * /
\\Replace this code @header (location)
echo "script" ;
echo "window.location='yourloation .php ' ;" ;
echo "/ script" ;
/ * ------- Your Php Code ----- * /
?
