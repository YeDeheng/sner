laravel return view :: make not working
I am having a brain melt over something seemingly simple.I am using ajax to upload images to this code @codeSnippetRemoved
The target page is index.blade.php which contains @codeSnippetRemoved
In Chrome DevTools Network Preview / Response I can see the images on the page @codeSnippetRemoved
But the page doesn't load in the browser, it stays on the upload form page.If I remove the jQuery ....
@codeSnippetRemoved
.... then it works.So what is going on with the jQuery that stops the return View :: make working and what can I do to get it to work?
UPDATEDThese are some of the variations I have tried - ajaxindex is the id of the container div in index.blade.php @codeSnippetRemoved
Add the following markup to index.blade.php : @codeSnippetRemoved
Then use the following JavaScript / jQuery in place of the JavaScript you posted : @codeSnippetRemoved
