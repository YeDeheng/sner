How to move content from QListWidget to a QStringList with PyQt4?
I have a dialog in which a user selects the files that needs, it adds (via QPushButton) in a QListWidget, my problem it ' s that I need to recover all the files from the QListWidget in a QStringList.
I tried like this, but something is wrong : @codeSnippetRemoved
