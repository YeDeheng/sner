How to save trained Neural Network ( Number recognitio from image )
I have written a neural network program to train for recognition digits from image using back propagation and feed-forward . Its working quite good . I just wanted to know that how do i save this trained neural network since i don't know what to save . My objective is to train my neural network just once because it takes very long time to train ( 1000 iteration , and many training sets ) and then i want to save it and load it for later use . I hope u understand my problem . I cannot reveal all my neural codes . But this is how execution code looks like @codeSnippetRemoved
After your network is trained you can store ( and later load ) the in-memory contents of NeuralNetwork and its children using Java Serialization .
class NeuralNetwork implements Serializable { ... }
Chain ObjectOutputStream with FileOutputStream . Call the method writeObject ( ... ) to write the NeuralNetwork object .
