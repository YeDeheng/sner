Recieving 0.0 when multiplying two doubles in an array. Any help? (noob issue)
I'm having quite a bit of trouble multiplying two doubles in an array. The result always seems to be 0.0 no matter what I do. I've tried casting, changing the variables from  double  to  int , etc. What am I doing wrong? Having a hard time finding a duplicate question but I'm more than sure there is one. Could someone direct me to it? Thanks 
My code: @codeSnippetRemoved
When I try to print any value of  speedMPH  the output is 0.0 
Any help would be appreciated. 
You're only modifying the first element of  speedMPH  ( n  is always  0 ). I'd recommend using a normal for-loop, because you need the current index. @codeSnippetRemoved
Casting to  double  is not necessary. If you really want to use an enhanced for-loop, you need to increment  n : @codeSnippetRemoved
The value of  n  is never increasing. The program continuously changes the value of  speedMPH[0] , not other values of the array. 
Try adding a  n++;  to your loop. 
I'm not neccesarily sure why you're experiencing this issue. Just by looking at it, I can see that all should return 0.0, except the first index or, so called index No. 0. 
You're using n as the iterator but you never increase it, thus all inputs you do to the speedMPH array will go into index 0. Here's my code, and it's working just fine. @codeSnippetRemoved
