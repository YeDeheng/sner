Can i use DataTable.Select() method to make simple paging?
I quickly view this MSDN article  using datacolumn.expression , but have found nothing. It looks like 'select expression' syntax doesn't support paging... 
Simple paging can be created most simply using LINQ. @codeSnippetRemoved
Paging is a mechanism of how you  SELECT  the data. Consider the following test data: @codeSnippetRemoved
if I wanted to page that data, and I didn't care how it was sorted, I could do it by  ID  so I could do something like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
and that would give me the first ten rows ( i.e.  a page). Note I'm also storing the last  ID  into an assumed class variable named  _id . How you store, or just recover later, that  ID  depends solely on your program. Now, if I need the next page, I could do something like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
and that would give me the next page. But what if I wanted to sort that data by  Name ? That changes the game a little. Consider the following code: @codeSnippetRemoved
that will give me the first page of data, sorted by  Name . But notice I'm storing the value of  Name  in the assumed class variable  _name  for later. Now when I want the next page I need to do something like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
that will get me the next page, but still ordered by  Name .  Sorting is very important when it comes to paging.  
NOTE:   the code isn't quite as simple as I've put forward. You can't just  Take(10)  because there may not be  10  to take. Further, you may not be able to just  store  the last  ID  or  Name , you may have to recover it from somewhere every time. Finally, you may need to support multi-sort, where it's sorted by more than one column, so keep that in mind too when providing the sort. 
FINAL NOTE:   it is much better to leverage  raw SQL  for paging than the aforementioned code - I only provided that code because you asked about the  Select  method on the  DataTable . It would be much better to simply construct the correct SQL statement, send it to the server, and then just display the results.
