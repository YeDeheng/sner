Visual studio 2010 and SAP crystal reports app crash
I developed a C# (Visual Studio 2010) application in .NET Framework 4.0 in conjunction with SAP Crystal Reports Support Pack 9 
When I deployed my application on Client computer I faced the following error after my application crash 
Faulting application name: TrackingApp.exe, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x537a1687      Faulting module name: cslibu-3-0.dll, version: 13.0.9.1312, time stamp: 0x53393fe8      Exception code: 0xc0000005      Fault offset: 0x00039a28      Faulting process id: 0xf00      Faulting application start time: 0x01cf7376d8df092d      Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\Tracking System\Tracking System\TrackingApp.exe      Faulting module path: C:\Program Files\SAP BusinessObjects\Crystal Reports for .NET Framework 4.0\Common\SAP BusinessObjects Enterprise XI 4.0\win32_x86\cslibu-3-0.dll      Report Id: 24b4faea-df6a-11e3-8422-d067e51beb2a  
The client has Windows 7 32-bit on his system. 
During testing I found there are two reports which made my application crash. These two reports contains sub reports. While other reports are simple reports with no sub reports. While checking these two reports I found that when I open (view using report viewer) my reports first time they work absolutely fine but when I close the report and re-open it second time the app crashes. 
Further I found when I open the other reports except these two faulty reports and then I open faulty reports they work fine and I can re-open multiple times  
What should be the issue. My code is in try catch block but it did not generate any exception @codeSnippetRemoved
