Iframe header location
I've a problem with iframe. My first file filtre.html contain iframe with a basic code like this: @codeSnippetRemoved
This file filtre.php is a drop down dynamic list with 3 levels (PHP/MYSQL). 
Filtre.php this file is actually a dynamic dropdown 3 levels and will find info in a DB. The submit sent to a URL and all working fine. 
My problem is with iframe. When I click on submit, target page is found in this part of 220x220 instead of reloading the parent page. 
I tried several solutions to no avail. Here is part of my php file (I deliberately truncated several parts) including the header location and the form: @codeSnippetRemoved
I also tried with javascript but without success. In this configuration there I removed the line: @codeSnippetRemoved
Here is the javascript code in the header: @codeSnippetRemoved
The problems in this case is that the document load loop.  
Anyway, I'm stuck, I thank you in advance for your help.

If I understand what's happening, the buttons are targeting the contents of the iframe and loading the page inside that, instead of the actual window?  If that's the case, set the  target  attribute the either  _parent  or  _top  and that should target the actual window. 
You can try this javascript code: 
?php  
/*-------Your Php Code-----*/  
\\Replace this code @header(location)  
echo " script ";  
echo "window.location='yourloation.php';";  
echo " /script ";  
/*-------Your Php Code-----*/  
?
