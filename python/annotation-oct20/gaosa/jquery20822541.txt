Add css class to parent li and sub li
I have a submenu like below: @codeSnippetRemoved
What I would like to have is, when I click to the child, it will add 'opened' class to parent and highlight the clicked element. My code only success on Menu 1 and failed on Menu 3. 
Notice that, in Menu 3, there are 2 parents for Sub-sub-Menu 1 and Sub-sub-Menu 2. So my question is, if i click on Sub-sub-Menu 1 or Sub-sub-Menu 2 it will highlight and add 'opened' class to 2 parents li above. 
Note: I try to implement unlimited level of menu 
Here is my full code  Fiddle  
you simply use the  not:  attribute in your  closest()  method to exclude all classes  root-level  @codeSnippetRemoved

If I understood correctly what was desired was being able to produce a menu like behavior and it is because of that I would like to present an alternate solution: 
Sample Fiddle   @codeSnippetRemoved
In this solution the parent menus are highlighted and the clicked item is marked as selected again I wanted to share my POV of this problem. I hope it helps. 
Inside your click event use $(this).parents('li') to get the top level parent li of the clicked element. I hope this helps. 
I think you should use a different selector(for the  click  event). Look for all  li a  pairs, corresponding to the submenu items, inside your  #main-menu  list @codeSnippetRemoved
