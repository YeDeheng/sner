python regex : extract contents of an HTML element
I have elements in an HTML page in this format : @codeSnippetRemoved
I want to use python to extract the " Dave Mason ' s Traffic Jam " part , the " Scottish Rite Auditorium " part etc . individually from the the text.using this regular expression ' . * ' returns from the first tag to the last tag before the next newline . How can I change the expression so that it only returns the chunk between the tag pairs ?
Edit : @HenryKeiter @Hakiko that'd be grand but this for an assignment that requires me to use python regex .
Here is a hint , not a full solution : you'll need to use a non-greedy regexp in your case . Basically , you'll need to use @codeSnippetRemoved
instead of @codeSnippetRemoved
Non-greedy means that a minimal pattern will be matched . By default - it ' s maximum .
Use Beautiful Soup : @codeSnippetRemoved
Returns @codeSnippetRemoved
