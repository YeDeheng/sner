"Dangerous" Android permissions that don't need to be accepted by users
Google states that permissions with dangerous as the value of protectionLevel have to be granted by the user on installation time.
One example for such a dangerous permission is android.permission.INTERNET.
But although apps have declared to use this permissions, it ' s treated like a normal permission, thus the user won't be asked about it.
This is also mentioned on How-To Geek.
Where does Google itself explain this behaviour?
Why is the INTERNET permission still dangerous, but treated like a normal one?
(instead of changing it to normal in the mapping file) Where does that happen?
Is there another mapping for "dangerous, but too important to worry users" permissions?
Or is it hardcoded?
Are there other dangerous permissions than INTERNET where this applies?
