How to get the echoed element in Jquery?
I've a php file that echoes an img element from a PHP file with id= "uploadedPhoto" .After uploading it i have a Jquery script that changes the size of the image on button click.
Before this it was working when i was using img as background of a div however now it isn't working.
HTML Code.

Can you please find the problem?
There is issue with DOM structure.
I guess your image automatically uses the size of div tag
you use to expand or reduce the size.
So i recommend you to try, fix the size of this div.
