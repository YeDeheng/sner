Unable to pass test with Mock
i'm testing laravel controller.Here ' s the respective route @codeSnippetRemoved
Here ' s the controller : @codeSnippetRemoved
In the view dashboard.showcategories, i have used foreach to loop through the $categories variable and have then used it.
Now i was trying to test this controller.
@codeSnippetRemoved
But it ' s showing an error @codeSnippetRemoved
However, if i delete following code from the test, it passes.
@codeSnippetRemoved
How to make this test pass with mockery?
In case you need Category model @codeSnippetRemoved
your mock does not return anything, and your foreach loop is expecting an array to loop over.
try setting a return value of an empty array @codeSnippetRemoved
