Getting input box values into an array in Javascript / HTML
I'm learning Javascript for a project.
I'm trying to try and get values from an dynamic number of text inputs into a multi-dimensional array.
I have tried this with 1 text field and it correctly saves into the array for further manipulation later.
However when i added an second text field and another dimension to the array, it broke.
Eventually i will have a drop down list to give the number of inputs once i figure it out.
Here ' s my current code, not very efficient really.

Btw, you have to insert ";" between function calls, not ","
onclick= "insert (this.form.name.value ); insert2 (this.form.name2.value );
You need to close all the td elements.
As arunes mentioned, modify the onclick call with ' ; ' seperator.
As mentioned in my comment, close html tag Not sure why you are using 2-d array, what you want can be done with 1-d array.
Here ' s the modified code, just go through-

Its better to make a single function to insert into array rather than 2 seperate functions.
In case you didn't figured it out yet here is the code : @codeSnippetRemoved
