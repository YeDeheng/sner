C# service as a daemon in debian with mono-service
I can't seem to find a way to get a C# service run as a " service " in debian.What Am I doing wrong ?
I followed this post from msdn to create a sample windows service : http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zt39148a(v=vs.80).aspx
I can run the service at my windows machine , Start and stop the service and see that it writes to MyNewLog .
Then I copy it ( .exe file ) to my debian machine and tries to run it with ( as root ) mono-service MyNewService.exe
The Syslog tell ' s me that the service have started !
I have no errors and I can't see any newly created logfiles in the system . What Am I doing wrong ?
If it helps , here is the code :P rogram.cs @codeSnippetRemoved
Service.cs @codeSnippetRemoved

Try logging somewhere else than with System.Diagnostics.EventLog , perhaps to a text file or similar .
I can't find anything recent , but this post suggests that the EventLog is simply discarded when running on Linux ; which would make sense .
EDIT :
Investigating the Mono source seems to bear this out . There are three possible options for event logging : win32 , local and null . If the MONO_EVENTLOG_TYPE environment variable is set to local , then on Linux the logs should be written to / var / lib / mono / eventlog by default .
You really need to isolate your logging code from your expectations - it seems that your service works fine , but the logging is the problem .
