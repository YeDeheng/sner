how to detect a mouse click on drawn image?
I am new to c# Windows Form Application Development.
I created a form with a panel in which the user can draw image on it.
How do I check if the image is clicked?
Just double-click on the form ' s image-panel (or whatever object you wish to detect click events on) and Visual Studio will automatically generate a OnClick() event.
Needless to say, I'm talking about the forms designer, not the actual form you will see when testing your code.
Alternatively, you can set which events you want to implement through the object ' s properties.
That way you can also implement OnKeyDown() or OnFocus() or any other kind of events.
Edit : If the image doesn't cover the entire panel, you'll have to check if the mouse position is within the image ' s dimension.
Assuming the image is drawn at position (imgOriginX, imgOriginY) and has the size (imgWidth, imgHeight) : @codeSnippetRemoved
In designer mode, right-click on the panel, go to Properties.In the Properties window, choose EVENTS (Lightning icon) .Double click on Click, then this code will be generated : @codeSnippetRemoved
