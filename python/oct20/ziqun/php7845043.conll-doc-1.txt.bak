loading Model causes blank / white screen CodeIgniter 2.0.3
When i load the model blogmodel.php it causes a white screen, but if i comment out the load model, its working.
my controller blog.php @codeSnippetRemoved
my model blogmodel.php @codeSnippetRemoved
I followed the user guide and I don't know what I did wrong.
I've switched on the display error in php.ini.developing on 11.10 ubuntu.
Tested on chrome and it gives me a server error
