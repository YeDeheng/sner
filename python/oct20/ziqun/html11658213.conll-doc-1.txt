Is there a markdown-like system , which creates multiple output files ?
I'm looking for an easy way to create a whole number of output files in a directory structure from a single input file . The input syntax should be similar to Markdown , or should at least support semantic structuring and links .
I want to use this to create small help package . So generating a table of content and support for Previous and Next links would be great as well .
Is there a tool for something like this ?
Alternatively , which markdown implementation is designed to be extensible for this something like this ?
