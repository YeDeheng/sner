data access object pattern with abstract factories, creation over generic types
I'm developing a database application for android devices.First thing I need to do is creating the data access layer.For this I want to use DAO-Pattern with abstract factories.
For all DAOs i have one Interface witch contains the declaration that all data object needs to implement.
(in my case : IDataObject) The specific DAOs are all represented by its own interface, extending the base interface of all DAOs.
base interface : @codeSnippetRemoved
a extensions : @codeSnippetRemoved
To create an data object I want use abstract to use abstract factories, something like : @codeSnippetRemoved
and the implementation : @codeSnippetRemoved
I don't get any error so far, but now I want to implement an factory builder : @codeSnippetRemoved
I get following errors (line 8) : @codeSnippetRemoved
and (line 9) @codeSnippetRemoved
Don't know how to fix this, any suggestions?
I would refactor Your ' s DataFactoryBuilder to something like that : @codeSnippetRemoved
I got following solution : @codeSnippetRemoved
but i get an warning on : return (IDataFactory) fac ; @codeSnippetRemoved
I think that is not a problem, I just have to supress it
