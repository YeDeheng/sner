Can i use DataTable.Select() method to make simple paging?
I quickly view this MSDN article using datacolumn.expression, but have found nothing.
It looks like ' select expression ' syntax doesn't support paging ...
Simple paging can be created most simply using LINQ.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Paging is a mechanism of how you SELECT the data.
Consider the following test data : @codeSnippetRemoved
if I wanted to page that data, and I didn't care how it was sorted, I could do it by ID so I could do something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
and that would give me the first ten rows (i.e. a page).
Note I'm also storing the last ID into an assumed class variable named _id.
How you store, or just recover later, that ID depends solely on your program.
Now, if I need the next page, I could do something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
and that would give me the next page.
But what if I wanted to sort that data by Name?
That changes the game a little.
Consider the following code : @codeSnippetRemoved
that will give me the first page of data, sorted by Name.
But notice I'm storing the value of Name in the assumed class variable _name for later.
Now when I want the next page I need to do something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
that will get me the next page, but still ordered by Name.
Sorting is very important when it comes to paging.
NOTE : the code isn't quite as simple as I've put forward.
You can't just Take (10) because there may not be 10 to take.
Further, you may not be able to just store the last ID or Name, you may have to recover it from somewhere every time.
Finally, you may need to support multi-sort, where it ' s sorted by more than one column, so keep that in mind too when providing the sort.
FINAL NOTE : it is much better to leverage raw SQL for paging than the aforementioned code - I only provided that code because you asked about the Select method on the DataTable.
It would be much better to simply construct the correct SQL statement, send it to the server, and then just display the results.
