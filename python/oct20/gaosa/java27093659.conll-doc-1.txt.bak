Recieving 0.0 when multiplying two doubles in an array.
Any help?
(noob issue)
I'm having quite a bit of trouble multiplying two doubles in an array.
The result always seems to be 0.0 no matter what I do.
I've tried casting, changing the variables from double to int, etc.
What am I doing wrong?
Having a hard time finding a duplicate question but I'm more than sure there is one.
Could someone direct me to it?
Thanks

When I try to print any value of speedMPH the output is 0.0
Any help would be appreciated.
You're only modifying the first element of speedMPH (n is always 0).
I'd recommend using a normal for-loop, because you need the current index.

Casting to double is not necessary.
If you really want to use an enhanced for-loop, you need to increment n : @codeSnippetRemoved
The value of n is never increasing.
The program continuously changes the value of speedMPH[0 ], not other values of the array.
Try adding a n++ ; to your loop.
I'm not neccesarily sure why you're experiencing this issue.
Just by looking at it, I can see that all should return 0.0, except the first index or, so called index No.
0.
You're using n as the iterator but you never increase it, thus all inputs you do to the speedMPH array will go into index 0.
Here ' s my code, and it ' s working just fine.
