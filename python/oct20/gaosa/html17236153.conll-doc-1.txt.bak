How to add a base url to generated elements?
I have a page where I want to display content from a website inside my app.
I have a parser which in this case grab the element from their site and into mine.
But I have this problems, the links serverside are like campaign.aspx?
wfege, when a users clicks it, I want to add a http://example.com before so the link will result in looking like http://example.com/campaign.aspx?wfege.
It this possible in javascript?
If so, how?
Please look at my fiddle, it ' s fully working and is an exact copy of my site.

This can be done in your HTML.
You need to add the base tag with the appropriate href, like this @codeSnippetRemoved
