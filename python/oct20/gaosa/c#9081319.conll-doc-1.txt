Can my .Net app reference two different versions of a .net framework library ?
Say I have two projects , P4 and P3 , targetting .net 4.0 and 3.5 respectively .
Each project also has a reference to System.Data.In the case of P4 , it will be to System.Data v4.0.0.0In the case of P3 , it will be to System.Data v2.0.0.0
Project P4 also references P3 .
If P4 is loaded and executed , it uses the .net 4.0 CLR . At runtime , references to System.Data seem to resolve to v4.0 inside both P4 and P3 . I can override this by using assemblyBinding redirects , but then both P4 and P3 resolve to v2.0 .
Is there any way I can configure my application so that P4 uses v4.0 and P3 uses v2.0 ?
If you have control over P3 , yes . Go to the references section of the project , find the System.Data reference , and view it ' s properties window ( right-click -> Properties ) .
Select " True " for the " Specific Version " property . Recompile , redeploy , etc .
Note that this will cause all sorts of runtime failures if .NET 2 , 3 , or 3.5 are not installed on the machine when the assembly attempts to load .
Edit
I've tried this , but with no luck . P3 still runs v4.0 . Do you know if this setting would have any visible effect in the assembly generated for P3 ? E.g. The manifest says " .ver 2:0 : 0:0 " whether " Specific Version " is set to true or not .
Try adding this to your app.config : @codeSnippetRemoved
Have a look at this : In-Process Side-by-Side It might be of some help .
