Slow down Jquery image slider after one cycle
i want to slow down my image slider on www.debruiloft-dj.nl after 1 cycle of the three images.
So after one cycle it slows down for example with 50% compared the previous cycle.
Is there a solution for this problem, thanks in advance
use the delay : -1000 (any time u wish in milliseconds) after ur code for cycle of images
