Convert a html div to a pdf
I have a sort of bill generated in my web page which gets displayed in a div id " bill " . I want that when the user clicks print , everything that is displayed in the " bill " div gets converted to pdf and it opens up automatically in another web page ( tab ) so that the user can print it ? Can anyone help me with the code for it ?

I sugest you use a PDF Utitlity to generate the pdf server side .
What is the best PDF open source library for Java ?
you can use open the page in a new window and write the bianary to the http response
You can also use a Javascript library called jsPDF for generating PDF files purely in client-side JavaScript .
