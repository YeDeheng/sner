Decode html string in JQuery Mobile template
I am using jquery templates which I populate using an ajax request.
However, one of the values returned is encoded HTML.
How can I encode it?
I have tried using ${$ .mobile .html (Body) .text() } but that didn't work for me.
My code : @codeSnippetRemoved
Html : @codeSnippetRemoved
After searching and searching I finally found the solution here : jQuery tmpl : How do I render Html?
Using {{ html Body }} in my template worked like a charm.
