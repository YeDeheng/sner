Linq Pattern Matching Problem
The code below searches through a file to see if a pattern matches and stores the file offset in the ' result ' variable . I then had a for each loop which cycles through the ' result ' variable to display the offsets which worked fine ... Untill , I had some further code to read in the file contents at each offset and perform a calculation on each read in and output it in the console .
For some reason the for each loop is only outputing the first calculation , instead of continuing to do all the other offsets .
Any help to why this for each loop is stopping at the first offset ?
Thanks in advance @codeSnippetRemoved
I think your problem is with Console.ReadKey() you will need to press a key in order to continue the foreach loop
There is only one reason possible to why the loop exits after one iteration :
result has only one value inside
