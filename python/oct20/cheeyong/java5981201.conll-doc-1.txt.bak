Double value negative after multiplication -Java
In my code i have following line.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Here c12 is double and fileSizeis double c12 have a value 1700 and fileSize have a value 1944038
but after multiplication i am getting -990102696.
Can any one help me on it?
Is that some size limits went wrong?
(int) 1700 * (int) 1944038 is equal to your -990102696.
Are you sure c12 and fileSize aren't integers?
If they are, the multiplication occurs with integer types, integer overflow and it is being promoted to double afterwards.
Use BigDecimal multiply method instead like this to safeguard against potential overlow issues while handling large double numbers : @codeSnippetRemoved
Your c12 and fileSize are most likely ints (+1 Tomasz).
Java multiplies the ints, which overflows, becoming negative, and then stores that negative value in your double.
Cast c12 and fileSize to double before multiplying : @codeSnippetRemoved
produces : @codeSnippetRemoved
Make a double on the fly : @codeSnippetRemoved
else, an c12 as int will be multiplied by another int, and the result overflows, and is later - too late - converted to double.
@codeSnippetRemoved
would help, but a filesize as float / double looks fishy.
double c12 = 1700 ; double fileSize = 1944038 ; double temp =( c12*fileSize ); System.out.println (temp );
Gives 3.3048646E9
I bet your c12 and fileSize are ints.
Hmm, I just tried that and I get "3.3048646E9".
You shouldn't get any overflow wrap around on a double : if you exceed the maximum, it should turn into "Infinity".
I suspect the problem is in whatever you're trying to do to write this number.
Or maybe you need to show us some more code.
