php, mySQL return last x rows
I'm working on a php / mySQL / ajax shoutbox and have run into a small snag.On the page I want the content to be loaded from oldest to newest, with the newest on the bottom.
I also want to limit the output to reduce load times once the database starts to get a lot of data in it.
Here is the current code ; @codeSnippetRemoved
I have tried using while ($row=array_reverse (mysql_fetch_array ($result ))) as well as $result = array_reverse (mysql_query ($q )) but both return an error that array_reverse needs to be fed an array.
So far anything I have found on the web from the SQL side have all been answered "just use DESC or ASC accordingly.
"
$res = mysql_query ($q ); $shouts = array() ;
while ($row = mysql_fetch_assoc ($res )) $shouts [] = $row ; $shouts = array_reverse ($shouts );
foreach ($shouts as $shout) { // show them ...
}
$result=mysql_query ($q );
unset ($temp_array );
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array ($result )) $temp_array [ ]= $row ;
$temp_array = array_reverse ($temp_array );
foreach ($temp_array as $row) { $classColor = getClassColor($row['char_id ' ]); echo "span class= '".
$classColor.
"' ".$row['username ' ].
"/ span : ",nl2br($row['shout_message ' ]).
"br /" ; }
If you want oldest to newest, and shout_id is auto increment just use @codeSnippetRemoved
You have DESC / ASC mixed up
Seems like a lit of work.
I just used this : @codeSnippetRemoved
