php , mySQL return last x rows
I'm working on a php / mySQL / ajax shoutbox and have run into a small snag.On the page I want the content to be loaded from oldest to newest , with the newest on the bottom . I also want to limit the output to reduce load times once the database starts to get a lot of data in it .
Here is the current code ; @codeSnippetRemoved
I have tried using while ( $row=array_reverse ( mysql_fetch_array ( $result ))) as well as $result = array_reverse ( mysql_query ( $q )) but both return an error that array_reverse needs to be fed an array .
So far anything I have found on the web from the SQL side have all been answered " just use DESC or ASC accordingly . "
$res = mysql_query ( $q ); $shouts = array() ;
while ( $row = mysql_fetch_assoc ( $res )) $shouts [] = $row ; $shouts = array_reverse ( $shouts );
foreach ( $shouts as $shout ) { // show them ... }
$result=mysql_query ( $q );
unset ( $temp_array );
while ( $row = mysql_fetch_array ( $result )) $temp_array [ ]= $row ;
$temp_array = array_reverse ( $temp_array );
foreach ( $temp_array as $row ) { $classColor = getClassColor($row['char_id ' ]); echo " span class= '" . $classColor . "' ".$row['username ' ] . " / span : ",nl2br($row['shout_message ' ] ) . " br / " ; }
If you want oldest to newest , and shout_id is auto increment just use @codeSnippetRemoved
You have DESC / ASC mixed up
Seems like a lit of work . I just used this : @codeSnippetRemoved
