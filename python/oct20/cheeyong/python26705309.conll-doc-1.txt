Quicksort without the final merge Python
I am new to coding and trying to implement quicksort in python . The following is the code but the output is not correct . Where am I going wrong ? Choosing pivot as the first element and without having to merge . @codeSnippetRemoved
After the changes , the code is @codeSnippetRemoved
I am getting a error , list index out of range .
These are making copies of slices of A @codeSnippetRemoved
Anything you do to the copy won't affect A
To modify A inplace , you should pass it as well as left and right indices as parameters @codeSnippetRemoved
Now remembering that left and right are indices here ( not lists as in your code ) . Modify the rest of your function to make changes to A directly
