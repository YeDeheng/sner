Quicksort without the final merge Python
I am new to coding and trying to implement quicksort in python.
The following is the code but the output is not correct.
Where am I going wrong?
Choosing pivot as the first element and without having to merge.
@codeSnippetRemoved
After the changes, the code is @codeSnippetRemoved
I am getting a error, list index out of range.
These are making copies of slices of A @codeSnippetRemoved
Anything you do to the copy won't affect A
To modify A inplace, you should pass it as well as left and right indices as parameters @codeSnippetRemoved
Now remembering that left and right are indices here (not lists as in your code).
Modify the rest of your function to make changes to A directly
