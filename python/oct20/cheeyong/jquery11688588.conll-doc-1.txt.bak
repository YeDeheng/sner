How to pass ajax object data to python file
I have written an ajax code to pass value to python file.
I used request.GET['user ' ] but it gives compile error.
Help me to give any method in python to catch the value.Below is python code : @codeSnippetRemoved
Ajax code : @codeSnippetRemoved
Compile Error : @codeSnippetRemoved
It looks like the function does not take request as a parameter, but it is impossible to pinpoint the problem since your code snippets are not complete.
