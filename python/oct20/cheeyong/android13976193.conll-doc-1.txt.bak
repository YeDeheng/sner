Android WebView shows plain text instead of html
First, I am going to say this is only an issue on Android 2 and older (4 seems to be unaffected and I didn't test 3).
I have a WebView that loads html from a string.
The HTML looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
You can see that css file looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
The WebView code looks like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
What Happens
I see the html code in the WebView as if I had set the mime type to plain text.
What I'd Expect (and what happens in Android 4.x
I see the html in the WebView
There are a few things that have to be true to show the symptoms I am seeing :
Android 2.x (I was using 2.3.7 and 2.2) The css has to be accessed via a url href= "http://www.robotsidekick.com/test.css?rev=0" as opposed to href= "test.css" (however it doesn't matter if it ' s a real css file href= "http://www.thisisnotarealurl.fake/test.css?rev=0 causes the same problem) The css must have a get parameter?
rev=0, but it doesn't matter what it is
Also wanted to note that the following did not make a difference :
Using the appropriate "instead of ' in the HTML Having the link tag close itself or not The contents of the css Adding a doctype!
DOCTYPE html to the HTML
Changing the webview.loadData line to this : @codeSnippetRemoved
Solves this problem.
It seems weird to me that a relative path with an unencoded?
doesn't cause problems, while a fake url with an unencoded?
does cause problems.
Also find it odd that the WebView changed enough in subsequent versions of Android that we don't have to go encoding our html anymore?
That sounds fishy.
