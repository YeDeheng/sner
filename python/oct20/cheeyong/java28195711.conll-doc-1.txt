JPA navigate unidirectional relationship
I have an unidirectional relationship . Here i have Employee and Andress entities . In Employee entity i have the following code : @codeSnippetRemoved
What is the correct way to find the Employee entity when i have only the Adress entity . Can I only do that via jpql ?
You could do it like this if you have , for example , the id of the address @codeSnippetRemoved
Using Hibernate criteria API , it would look like this @codeSnippetRemoved
