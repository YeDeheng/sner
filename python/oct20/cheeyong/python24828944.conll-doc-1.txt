Use Python extension with old version of Python
I want to use the cx_oracle module ( http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net ) in a project . It is currently built against Python 2.7 . However I only have 2.6.6 installed on the machine , is it possible to rebuild a module against an older version of Python ?
You'll need to build a fresh copy for your older Python version . cx_oracle comes with the source , all you need is the Oracle client libraries ( which come with headers ) .
cx_oracle 5.1.1 has a version for Python 2.6 . You can download and use that .
You will be missing these features in 5.1.1 by not using 5.1.2
Added support for LONG_UNICODE which is a type used to handle long unicode strings . These are not explicitly supported in Oracle but can be used to bind to NCLOB , for example , without getting the error unimplemented or unreasonable conversion requested . Set the row number in a cursor when executing PL / SQL blocks as requested by Robert Ritchie . Added support for setting the module , action and client_info attributes during connection so that logon triggers will see the supplied values , as requested by Rodney Barnett .
