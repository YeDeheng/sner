Storing string or integer data in PHP class properties?
Best practice?
When implementing classes, is it better to prefer storing integers or strings as data?
Does it matter?
What is the best practice for data / property storage for PHP classes?
For a specific example, for a Poll class, there ' s a setting for logging.
The options are IP, cookie, both, or none.
Should these properties be saved as strings, ints, an enum, etc .?
In general you should select the type that ' s most natural to the machine, namely integers.
With that in mind, a single int $log_level that corresponds to some constants would fit the bill perfectly (eg. 0= none, 1= IP, 2= cookie, 3= both).
Alternatively, you could create your own enum.
