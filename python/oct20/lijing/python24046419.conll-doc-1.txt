Error in reading data in aws data pipeline activity from s3 bucket
We have AWS data pipeline where we have an activity ( python script ) which reads / writes data from / to s3 bucket . We have noticed recently a failure in an activity where the read from s3 fails due to closing of socket connection . The error is intermittent . The failure happens exactly at the same line of the script . @codeSnippetRemoved
In our code , we read data from s3 in 1KB chunks . The failure happens in the middle of reading from a file in s3 . Does anyone know if there is an upper limit on the number of connections allowed from an EC2 instance to s3 bucket ?
