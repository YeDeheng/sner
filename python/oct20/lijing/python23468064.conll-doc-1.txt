readlines() cannot read lines after using readline()
The following simple code reads a CSV file and returns the number of lines of the file . As you can see in the output , the file has 501 lines . @codeSnippetRemoved
But if I insert a readline() before using readlines() , the latter does not reach at the end of the file . @codeSnippetRemoved
Is there any basic mistake in my code ? How can I mix readline() and readlines() ? ( actually I don't need to mix these two functions in my real program , but I am just curious ... )

This has something to do with the codecs module . Because when you do the same thing with the regular python open statement , it works as expected : @codeSnippetRemoved
