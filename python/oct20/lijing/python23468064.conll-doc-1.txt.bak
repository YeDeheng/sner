readlines() cannot read lines after using readline()
The following simple code reads a CSV file and returns the number of lines of the file.
As you can see in the output, the file has 501 lines.

But if I insert a readline() before using readlines(), the latter does not reach at the end of the file.

Is there any basic mistake in my code?
How can I mix readline() and readlines()?
(actually I don't need to mix these two functions in my real program, but I am just curious ...)
You can download the file at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/16653989/tmp/tmp.csv
This has something to do with the codecs module.
Because when you do the same thing with the regular python open statement, it works as expected : @codeSnippetRemoved
