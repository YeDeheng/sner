Want an iPhone / iPad / iOS Webpage that is 100% width / height
I'm trying to get a site that is simply 100% of the possible width / height of a device , after scrolling down far enough to get rid of the address bar . Hopefully that makes sense ?
I just need the simple dimensions so I can scroll the device to 0 , 0 and see as much of my page as possible . e.g. simply 320x400 ( 320 width , 400 might = height - title bar - footer )
The reason for this is that I'm putting a single DIV on a page that is a " viewport " into content that moves around , think google maps . I just want this div to fill all available space .
The problem is that I can't seem to detect the available window height . I always seem to get the screen size - the title bar - the address bar - optional debug bar - footer . How do I detect the " largest possible size " ?
If you're using javascript , try alerting : ' innerWidth ' ;

Put html , body with height : 100% ; and the div as position : absolute ; top : 0 ;b ottom : 0 ; left : 0 ; right : 0 ; and then you dont need the exact width / height of the viewport , the div will already use the maximum possible space .
But if you still want to detect , jQuery got the $ ( element_you_want ) .width() and .height() also that might do the trick . Try with document or only body ( with 100% height )
Answering this myself : @codeSnippetRemoved
The basic idea is that I force the window to be larger than I know it can support , remove the address bar then measure the size . I can now go and re-size this div appropriately .
