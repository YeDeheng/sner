Accessing views from superclass
I am trying to centralize my code for handling navigation drawers into a superclass that all activities extend.
The super class itself extends Activity but I can't seem to figure out how to access the subclass ' s view (findviewbyid returns null).
How can I access the views inflated in CheckinActivity from CommonCode?
Superclass oncreate : @codeSnippetRemoved
SubClass @codeSnippetRemoved
What I do is have seperate XMLs for each sub activity, but have all the xml ids of your navigation drawers be the same.
Next, when you start any subclass of your extended activity, pass a bundle with the contextView id - R.layout.MY_SUB_ACTIVITY - in a bundle, and actually set the content view for each sub activity from within your super class.
Afterwards, you can use findViewByID to find your drawers, set them up in the super class, and then just handle your subclass ' s views from within it ' s own class.
Your views are likely returning null, because your running your super class ' s onCreate before your subclass ' s - therefore setContentView hasn't been called yet (so findViewByID won't work)
EDIT :
Also, you don't HAVE to name all the navigation drawer IDs the same -- I just think it ' s easier to use an include tag, to minimize redundancy in your xml files.
For Example :
Subclass - @codeSnippetRemoved
SuperClass : @codeSnippetRemoved
