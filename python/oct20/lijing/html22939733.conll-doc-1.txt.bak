HTML table td ' s not properly alignt
I'm having an weird problem.
I've got an table with an input and some text.
Only problem is that 1 row is shorter than the others.
I've moved the row down, but that also didn't work.
I've also compared them with the other rows, but i can't find the difference.
An image says more than thousands words they say, so here ' s an screen pick from the live testing area :
Also, here ' s an JSFiddle of the relevant code.
And here ' s the code also : @codeSnippetRemoved
Your first row ' s attribute colspan is wrong, change : @codeSnippetRemoved
with : @codeSnippetRemoved
Here is the fiddle updated : http://jsfiddle.net/D5fJa/1
