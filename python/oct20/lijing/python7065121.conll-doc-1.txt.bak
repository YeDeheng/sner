Appengine BulkLoader problem using development server
I am doing something that should be simple and getting stuck over and over again.
I am getting this error when uploading quite simple csv files to my development server : @codeSnippetRemoved
The exact output being : @codeSnippetRemoved
This is the app.yaml file : @codeSnippetRemoved
This the shell call to perform the upload : @codeSnippetRemoved
This is the uploader code : @codeSnippetRemoved
And this the cols.csv file : @codeSnippetRemoved
Any help will be really welcome.
I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.
I am using Appengine 1.5.2 on Mac Osx Leopard.
I have tried both both python 2.5.4 and 2.6.6 (just in case).
Thanks in advance and best regards!
When starting dev_appserver, pass the -- default_partition= "" parameter.
On newer SDK, use the -- application =d ev~ your-app option.
I recently had the same problem, hence I created a script to do this : @codeSnippetRemoved
