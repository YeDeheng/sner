Slow user input on firefox, but not chrome
I have a web page with a little over 1000 text inputs and 100 check boxes created in the following way :
echo "td input type='text ' id= '".
$a.
"-".
$b.
"-inc".
"' autocomplete='off ' / td ";
the input freezes momentarily when switching between input elements and typing. at first i thought the problem was that firefox retains information on refresh, but with the autocomplete property it no longer does.
when i check the profiler the profiler says messageQueue.push is the culprit.
I am especially confused as chrome is perfectly fine.
any idea what is slowing the input and how to fix it?
I think it is because you are using a table.
Use div ' s instead of tables, that ' s a lot faster.
