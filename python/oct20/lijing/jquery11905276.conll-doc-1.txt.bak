using variables in place of id names in jquery
I desire to use a variable i that is incremented in a for loop to create unique id ' s in div ' s in a mako template.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Result hoping for in the html when the javascript is run : @codeSnippetRemoved
etc.Instead I get : @codeSnippetRemoved
Any suggestions?
Following the suggestions below, I changed the code to @codeSnippetRemoved
Now I get an error message : SyntaxError : missing) after argument list[Break On This Error ] @codeSnippetRemoved
with arrow on the p in photo
FINALLY !!
I ended up having to define the whole variable outside of the jQuery command as it kept having problems with the + sign in the jquery href.
I used the following code to obtain the desired results.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Change this : @codeSnippetRemoved
to : @codeSnippetRemoved
Please note that if the doctype of the page is not HTML5, IDs must begin with a letter.
@codeSnippetRemoved
