Accessing views from superclass
I am trying to centralize my code for handling navigation drawers into a superclass that all activities extend . The super class itself extends Activity but I can't seem to figure out how to access the subclass ' s view ( findviewbyid returns null ) .
How can I access the views inflated in CheckinActivity from CommonCode ?
Superclass oncreate : @codeSnippetRemoved
SubClass @codeSnippetRemoved
What I do is have seperate XMLs for each sub activity , but have all the xml ids of your navigation drawers be the same .
Next , when you start any subclass of your extended activity , pass a bundle with the contextView id - R.layout.MY_SUB_ACTIVITY - in a bundle , and actually set the content view for each sub activity from within your super class .
Afterwards , you can use findViewByID to find your drawers , set them up in the super class , and then just handle your subclass ' s views from within it ' s own class .
Your views are likely returning null , because your running your super class ' s onCreate before your subclass ' s - therefore setContentView hasn't been called yet ( so findViewByID won't work )
EDIT :
Also , you don't HAVE to name all the navigation drawer IDs the same -- I just think it ' s easier to use an include tag , to minimize redundancy in your xml files .
For Example :
Subclass - @codeSnippetRemoved
SuperClass : @codeSnippetRemoved
