Appengine BulkLoader problem using development server
I am doing something that should be simple and getting stuck over and over again . I am getting this error when uploading quite simple csv files to my development server : @codeSnippetRemoved
The exact output being : @codeSnippetRemoved
This is the app.yaml file : @codeSnippetRemoved
This the shell call to perform the upload : @codeSnippetRemoved
This is the uploader code : @codeSnippetRemoved
And this the cols.csv file : @codeSnippetRemoved
Any help will be really welcome . I cant figure out what I am doing wrong .
I am using Appengine 1.5.2 on Mac Osx Leopard . I have tried both both python 2.5.4 and 2.6.6 ( just in case ) .
Thanks in advance and best regards !
When starting dev_appserver , pass the -- default_partition= "" parameter .
On newer SDK , use the -- application =d ev~ your-app option .
I recently had the same problem , hence I created a script to do this : @codeSnippetRemoved
