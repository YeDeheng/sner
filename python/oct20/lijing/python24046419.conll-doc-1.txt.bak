Error in reading data in aws data pipeline activity from s3 bucket
We have AWS data pipeline where we have an activity (python script) which reads / writes data from / to s3 bucket.
We have noticed recently a failure in an activity where the read from s3 fails due to closing of socket connection.
The error is intermittent.
The failure happens exactly at the same line of the script.
@codeSnippetRemoved
In our code, we read data from s3 in 1KB chunks.
The failure happens in the middle of reading from a file in s3.
Does anyone know if there is an upper limit on the number of connections allowed from an EC2 instance to s3 bucket?
