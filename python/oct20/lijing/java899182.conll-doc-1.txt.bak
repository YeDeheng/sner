Hibernate calls flush on find- causes not-null error
I have a process which updates a tree to the database, and in doing so, performs reads to check for duplicates entities.
I'm finding that trying to do a criteria.uniqueResult() midway through this process causes the following error :
org.hibernate.PropertyValueException : not-null property references a null or transient value
Digging through the stack trace, I see that the uniqueResult() is flushing the session, attempting to perform updates that aren't ready to go to the database yet.

Have I set something up wrong here?
Any help greatly appreciated.

Turn off auto-flushing on the Session object to fix this exception.

This is not your error however.
Something earlier in your code is causing the in memory objects to be in an invalid state which is trying to be persisted to the DB during the autoflush.
hibernate remembers with objects needs to be saved. when issuing a select, hibernate will flush these changes. this ensures the select will return the correct results.
setting flushmode to anything else than FlushMode.AUTO will prevent this behaviour.
But the error is in your code, where you pass an incomplete object to hibernate to persist or update.
So the correct solution is to pass the object later to hibernate, when it is complete.
I've pulled my hair out many times trying to get to the bottom of these issues.
The problem being that it ' s so difficult to get to the root of the issue causing it.
If you're nearing your wits end you can also execute the supporting queries such as findAll in a new session : @codeSnippetRemoved
That has usually circumvented the problem for me in most cases.
