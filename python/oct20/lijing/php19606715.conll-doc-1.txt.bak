PHP questions about inputs and checkboxes
I have 2 questions :
what is the best way to fill an input in php (for example in asp.net : textbox1.Text = "hello" ;), I tried input type= "text" name= "name" value= "?
php echo $name?
"and then in my php script : $name = $myObj['name ' ];.
Is there any other way?
How can I uncheck a checkbox in php and not by renedering the whole checkbox input?
Thanks a lot
input type= "text" name= "name" value= "?
php echo $name?
"
To check the boxes, use : @codeSnippetRemoved
