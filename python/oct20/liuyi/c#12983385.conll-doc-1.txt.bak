More efficient way to calculate CPU Usage
So I'm writing a task manager clone, and right now I'm using this to calculate the CPU usage %s of each process.
The problem is this is very slow ; I was just wondering if there is a way to speed this up.
Also, I'm not allowed to use PerformanceCounter ' s methods and / or WMI.

Use PerformanceCounter components to get different performance statistics : @codeSnippetRemoved
And here is sample of creating something like task manager.
Also consider using Win API function GetProcessTimes.
