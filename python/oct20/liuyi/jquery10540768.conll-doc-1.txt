Jquery - Drop event not occuring if size of ' draggable div ' is greater than ' droppable div '
Possible Duplicate : jQuery UI draggable to smaller droppable
I have a draggable div and a droppable div . The draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div . So the drop event is not happening . @codeSnippetRemoved
When I made dimension of draggable div smaller than dropable div , then drop event triggered successfully .
Please guide me on how can I resolve this .
All you need to do is change the tolerance of your droppable .
Specifies which mode to use for testing whether a draggable is ' over ' a droppable . Possible values : ' fit ' , ' intersect ' , ' pointer ' , ' touch ' . @codeSnippetRemoved
By default it is intersect , requiring 50% overlap . Perhaps try pointer .
You can change the tolerance option to touch in the droppable method
http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#option-tolerance @codeSnippetRemoved
The default is intersect , which means your draggable div has to overlap the droppable div by 50% .
