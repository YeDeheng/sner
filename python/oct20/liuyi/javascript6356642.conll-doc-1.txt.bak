Textareas can only contain text.
Textareas can only contain text, but you can overlap elements.
Here is an example : http://jsfiddle.net/2qMb3/1
This uses a styled div instead of an image, but you can easily use an image instead of the div.
As other said TextArea only contains Text but, you can try something like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
Here is a working example ; you have to manipulate it according to your requirements.
You might want to look into using a WYSIWYG editor such as TinyMCE or CKEditor.
You can use jQuery to add simple CSS to the textarea on click
The HTML @codeSnippetRemoved
The CSS : @codeSnippetRemoved
The Javascript : @codeSnippetRemoved
See it in action : http://jsfiddle.net/gksTQ
