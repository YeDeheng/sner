Jquery - Drop event not occuring if size of ' draggable div ' is greater than ' droppable div '
Possible Duplicate : jQuery UI draggable to smaller droppable
I have a draggable div and a droppable div.
The draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable div.
So the drop event is not happening.
@codeSnippetRemoved
When I made dimension of draggable div smaller than dropable div, then drop event triggered successfully.
Please guide me on how can I resolve this.
All you need to do is change the tolerance of your droppable.
Specifies which mode to use for testing whether a draggable is ' over ' a droppable.
Possible values : ' fit ', ' intersect ', ' pointer ', ' touch '.
@codeSnippetRemoved
By default it is intersect, requiring 50% overlap.
Perhaps try pointer.
You can change the tolerance option to touch in the droppable method
http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/#option-tolerance @codeSnippetRemoved
The default is intersect, which means your draggable div has to overlap the droppable div by 50%.
