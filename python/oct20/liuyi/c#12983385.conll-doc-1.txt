More efficient way to calculate CPU Usage
So I'm writing a task manager clone , and right now I'm using this to calculate the CPU usage %s of each process . The problem is this is very slow ; I was just wondering if there is a way to speed this up .
Also , I'm not allowed to use PerformanceCounter ' s methods and / or WMI . @codeSnippetRemoved
Use PerformanceCounter components to get different performance statistics : @codeSnippetRemoved
And here is sample of creating something like task manager .
Also consider using Win API function GetProcessTimes .
