Find First check number in Quickbooks using QBFC
I am using Quickbooks QBFC and want to retrive the value of " First Check Number " field programatically .
It can be found in Quickbooks at File > Print Forms > Checks
Please suggest how this can be done or any reference i can look at .
You can't do this directly , but you can query for the most recent checks that have been written against the account that you are interested in . The default first check number will be one greater than the highest check number that ' s been written .
As a rule , I don't write people ' s code for them , I'm making an exception today only because it ' s Friday and I'm in a crazy mood . The following code can be used as a starting point for a useful last check number routine . In order to have a realistic , usable routine you , not I , will have to deal with all of the eccentricities that attach to the way people use their checkbooks : non-numeric numbers , numbers out of sequence , etc .
Please note : this code uses the Zombie open source library and QBFC 11 . @codeSnippetRemoved
