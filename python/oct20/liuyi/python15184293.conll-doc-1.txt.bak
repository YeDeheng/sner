Fit two normal distributions (histograms) with MCMC using pymc?
I am trying to fit line profiles as detected with a spectrograph on a CCD.
For ease of consideration, I have included a demonstration that, if solved, is very similar to the one I actually want to solve.
I've looked at this : http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/46626/fitting-model-for-two-normal-distributions-in-pymc and various other questions and answers, but they are doing something fundamentally different than what I want to do.

My question : Can PyMC (or some variant) give me the mean, amplitude, and sigma for the two components used above?
Please note that the functions that I will actually fit on my real problem are NOT Gaussians -- so please provide the example using a generic function (like GaussFunc in my example), and not a "built-in" pymc.Normal() type function.
Also, I understand model selection is another issue : so with the current noise, 1 component (profile) might be all that is statistically justified.
But I'd like to see what the best solution for 1, 2, 3, etc. components would be.
I'm also not wed to the idea of using PyMC -- if scikit-learn, astroML, or some other package seems perfect, please let me know!
EDIT :
I failed a number of ways, but one of the things that I think was on the right track was the following : @codeSnippetRemoved
But I could not construct a mc.model that worked.
Not the most concise PyMC code, but I made that decision to help the reader.
This should run, and give (really) accurate results.
I made the decision to use Uniform priors, with liberal ranges, because I really have no idea what we are modelling.
But probably one has an idea about the centroid locations, and can use a better priors there.

Important
Keep in mind the algorithm is agnostic to labeling, so the results might show profile1 with all the characteristics from profile2 and vice versa.
