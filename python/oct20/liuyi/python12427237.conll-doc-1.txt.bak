is there a light (er) weight framework for ruby, like web.py for python?
I've recently been seeing more and more about lighter and lighter weight web frameworks - mainly for python (flask, web.py).
I'm just curious if there ' s anything similar for ruby.
I haven't found anything in my travels yet but maybe i'm not travelling in the right places.
You should use Sinatra if you want a light weight ruby web framework.
Check out Grape if you're looking to build a REST-like API.
Here ' s a nice primer.
Camping is good, despite being slightly ... special.
Ramaze can be very lightweight.
Oh, and I should add that depending on your definition of lightweight, you can build lightweight apps in Rails.
