How to detect HTML elements movements ?
I need to detect when an image is moved . The point is that my page has a related HTML element ( another image ) to the first one that depends on its position . I though that a plugin like Watch can help , but the only properties I know involved with position ( top and left ) are not changed never to this plugin ( keep its original value to ' auto ') .
How can I get an event triggered when there is a page element move ?
UPDATE : In order to avoid missunderstandigs , I'll explain what really happens . I have an image ( call it AUX , position absolute ) that is situated in function of another image position ( image BASE ) . BASE and AUX don't share anything in the HTML except the BODY element , so it ' s not possible to use position relative or similar . So , I have a function that gets BASE position and computes AUX position . The problem is when the page is loaded : function is called when document is loaded and BASE has a position different from the final position ( when other elements are loaded , like other images , javascript functions , etc , BASE changes its position ) . This makes AUX have an invalid position ( it was valid , but not yet ) .
Instead of using javascript to set the position , I would use javascript to make them both a child of a minimal common element so that relative positioning schemes could be used . Because otherwise , you would need to poll for the position and update , and at best you can only do that every 10-15 ms or so .
