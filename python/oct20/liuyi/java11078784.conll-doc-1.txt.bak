Reference (not copy) a subrange of a one-dimensional array?
Suppose I have the following method signature @codeSnippetRemoved
and I call it like this : @codeSnippetRemoved
then, since arrays are objects, and objects are reference types, f receives a reference to the ints, and can change their value so the caller can see the changes.
Now how can I then call f in a way that it receives a reference to the array elements 2, 3, 4 (i.e. subrange from index 1 to 3 inclusive) without copying myValues?
Something like @codeSnippetRemoved
which of course does not compile (and would leave open which size the array would have) but might transport the idea I am looking for?
In other languages, I could use pointer arithmetics to calculate the address of myValues[2 ], and treat it a the beginning of an array of integer, and pass an explicit count parameter.
(Quite type-unsafe, of course.)
Can I do this in Java without copying the three elements ' values to an intermediate array?
Sub-question : Are the array elements, being value types, stored at consecutive addresses at all, or is the array composed of elements that are references to integers?
Could it be the question does not make sense because even if the answer to the latter was "yes", I could not build on that since that would be an implementation detail that a Java source must not build upon it?
It even cannot -- there is no semantics for it, right?
Edit : Stupid index error
You cannot return a range / subset of items in arrays (also Collection) without creating a new instance of the container.
I cannot answer the second without guessing, but IF the JVM wants to allocate 2 regions of memory for one array, it can do it without you knowing.
You can use List instead of an array.
@codeSnippetRemoved
In C / C++ this would be terribly easy to do with a bit of pointer arithmetic, but in Java, I am not so sure it is possible.
The best you could do is use the copyOfRange method although that makes a deep copy.
