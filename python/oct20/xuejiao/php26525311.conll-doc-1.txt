Broken png image using Laravel Asset Pipeline despite 200 OK status
I'm using Codesleeve / asset pipeline on my Laravel project to serve css , js and image files . It on the whole works fine but there is an issue with displaying css-loaded images . The image does not display and shows the browser ' s " broken image " symbol when loading it directly ( http://art.ipscap.com/assets/select2.png for example ): e.g .
Upon inspecting the page it shows the image is loaded successfully with 200 OK status ( or cached ) but there seems to be an error displaying it . Seeing as the image in question displays fine on my local machine and the problem is only in production is there a way to diagnose this issue ?
Edit : Still haven ' t managed to find a solution for this . For reference the live broken image url is https://art.ipscap.com/assets/select2.png . The image itself is in app / assets / images / select2.png and the readme in the same directory states :
If you place an image here called foobar.png then you can access that image by going to http:// hostname / assets / foobar.png
I find it strange as the image does not fail to load but is being broken by asset pipeline . The same does not seem to occur to other images in the app such as the header jpeg image .
Do you use different server software on your local and production server ? I see the production uses nginx . In that case , you might have to add something to your config as stated here :
