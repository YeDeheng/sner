Displaying Image in Android
I put the must.jpg in drawable-hdpi folder and created this method.
@codeSnippetRemoved
I want to display image on the screen by calling this method in mainActivity @codeSnippetRemoved
But when I launch app it crashes.
I will appreciate any help.
activity_main.xml @codeSnippetRemoved

One problem is that the Android device will most likely not have a directory named / BakuMovies / res / drawable-hdpi.
This is the directory structure of your development environment and is not directly transferred to the device.
Other than that, I cannot give without knowing what you are trying to do.
Edit :
Note that all the resources in your res directory are included in your app ' s .APK file.
They are not loaded to the device as individual files.
In order to access resources (other than strings) in Java code, you need to use a Resources object.
You get one by calling getResources() on an Activity object.
Once you have the Resources object, call getDrawable() or getDrawableForDensity() to get a drawable resource.
Try this.

First you have to add ImageView on your activity_main layout and set its id as android : id= "@+id / imageView".
There are so many things you could avoid and very easily load the image you want into the ImageView.
Do something like this : - @codeSnippetRemoved
Update : - To insert an ImageView dynamically, do this in your onCreate().
@codeSnippetRemoved
You used drawable.
You call setImageDrawable method and than set resource getResources () .getDrawable set id getdrawable method than image will be showing.
The most probable cause is that your application is running out of memory while trying to decode the image in the line below @codeSnippetRemoved
What are the dimensions of this image that you are trying to load?
In your activity you can call this to get your Drawable resource as a Drawable object and set the image as below : @codeSnippetRemoved
OR
If you want to show your drawable in an ImageView you can do this : @codeSnippetRemoved
or in your xml file @codeSnippetRemoved
