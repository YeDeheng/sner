change url according to the selected # href with jquery
I have a content slider and I want that the respective link of the content navigation is always shown in the url, so that I can also link to contents of the slider that are not shown by default.
e.g. www.example.com/#exampleLink
I know that I can find the according link via $ (this) .attr ("href ") but I don't know how to attach it to the url .. and of course I also don't want the screen to jump to the top of the container when one of the navigation links is clicked ..
Thanks in advance for your help!
here is my script : @codeSnippetRemoved
and here the html of the slider : @codeSnippetRemoved
use : $(this).attr('href',$(this).attr('href')+'attachedContent ') ;
window.location.hash = ' someValue '
This will add (or change) the value after the # in the URL to someValue.
Ok, I used now a combination of your suggestions.
It seems to work now how I wanted it.
BUT it does so just in Firefox, if I try Chrome it alters the url, the slider works, but the screen jumps up to the top of the slider container ..
Any further suggestions?
Here is the current jquery : @codeSnippetRemoved
