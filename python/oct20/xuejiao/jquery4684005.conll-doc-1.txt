change url according to the selected # href with jquery
I have a content slider and I want that the respective link of the content navigation is always shown in the url , so that I can also link to contents of the slider that are not shown by default . e.g. www.example.com/#exampleLink
I know that I can find the according link via $ ( this ) .attr ( " href ") but I don't know how to attach it to the url .. and of course I also don't want the screen to jump to the top of the container when one of the navigation links is clicked ..
Thanks in advance for your help !
here is my script : @codeSnippetRemoved
and here the html of the slider : @codeSnippetRemoved
use : $(this).attr('href',$(this).attr('href')+'attachedContent ') ;
window.location.hash = ' someValue '
This will add ( or change ) the value after the # in the URL to someValue .
Ok , I used now a combination of your suggestions . It seems to work now how I wanted it . BUT it does so just in Firefox , if I try Chrome it alters the url , the slider works , but the screen jumps up to the top of the slider container .. Any further suggestions ?
Here is the current jquery : @codeSnippetRemoved
