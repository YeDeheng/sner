How to set the Object3D position and rotation same as the added mesh?
[ three.js ]
When I create an Object3D model and add the meshes to it, how do I set the position and rotation of the added mesh to same as the Object3D model, like when I rotate and position the Object3D there should be no difference in angle of rotation between the Object3D and the added mesh.
How do I achieve such result?
If your Object3D model is called obj, then after obj.add (mesh) any changes to obj (position / rotation / scale) will change mesh in the same way.
If instead you don't want mesh to be attached to obj, but you still want them to have the same position and rotation, you could try @codeSnippetRemoved
Hope this helps!
