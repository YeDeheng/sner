DB geography type MakeValid does not seem to be working
I have an application where the user draws zones and later I check if a polyline crosses them .
All of a sudden the application crashed out with the error : @codeSnippetRemoved
I was surprised at the message ' Use MakeValid ' as I AM using ' MakeValid ' as shown below : @codeSnippetRemoved
I later found the offending polygon ( see image ) has been drawn pretty badly and I guess this is causing the issue .
So my specific questions are :
Am I using MakeValid correctly ? I thought MakeValid() would resolve this kind of thing ... Obviously I have no control over the drawing skills of my client so if MakeValid doesn't help for badly drawn polygons , is there some other way of er ... making this valid ?
Many thanks .
OK , so the issue was indeed an invalid polygon zone held in the database .
The ' Use MakeValid ' in the error message triggered some wrong assumptions as I was already using MakeValid . Actually this error was triggered from an invalid Polygon zone and not the PolyLine I was using in the query .
To protect against this I have added ' MakeValid() ' to the INSERT SQL Statement so that no invalid polygons can ever exist within the database again .
I have tested inserting an invalid polygon with and without ' MakeValid ' within the INSERT statement and can confirm adding ' MakeValid ' does resolve the issue . @codeSnippetRemoved
