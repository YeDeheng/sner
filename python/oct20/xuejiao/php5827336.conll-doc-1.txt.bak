Magento : Is it safe to override event observer core class?
Suppose, there is an event observer class in core.
I can override it.
But, is it safe?
I mean, does it affect other functions of the observer class?
Like, if there are two functions in core observer class and I did override only one function.
Then, will the other function work safely as before.
I think it is similar to model override and should be safe.
Am I right?
Edit : -
For example,
There is a class CoreClassA in core.
There is a function coreFunctionA in CoreClassA.
An event core_event_a is dispatched in this coreFunctionA.
Another core module CoreModuleB is creating event observer with core_event_a.
So, whenever core_event_a is dispatched, CoreModuleB ' s event observer is called.
Suppose, CoreModuleB ' s event observer contains two functions.
One for core_event_a dispatch action (let us name it eventDispatchA) and another for some other event dispatch action (let ' s say eventDispatchX).
In my custom module, I want to override eventDispatchA.
Basically, I want to change the some code in eventDispatchA or, I may just want to skip / omit this function.
I can override it.
But, will it affect eventDispatchX if I do so?
Or, is there any other better way instead of overriding event observer?
Most probably it will but if you override something that others might be using it ' s always worth to make something similar : @codeSnippetRemoved
and as others have told you : "if you are in need to change / override the core then you are probably doing it wrong" and it ' s better to ask in different manner by describing what you want to do and why
