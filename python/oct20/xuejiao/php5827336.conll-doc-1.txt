Magento : Is it safe to override event observer core class ?
Suppose , there is an event observer class in core . I can override it . But , is it safe ? I mean , does it affect other functions of the observer class ?
Like , if there are two functions in core observer class and I did override only one function . Then , will the other function work safely as before .
I think it is similar to model override and should be safe . Am I right ?
Edit : -
For example ,
There is a class CoreClassA in core . There is a function coreFunctionA in CoreClassA . An event core_event_a is dispatched in this coreFunctionA . Another core module CoreModuleB is creating event observer with core_event_a . So , whenever core_event_a is dispatched , CoreModuleB ' s event observer is called . Suppose , CoreModuleB ' s event observer contains two functions . One for core_event_a dispatch action ( let us name it eventDispatchA ) and another for some other event dispatch action ( let ' s say eventDispatchX ) . In my custom module , I want to override eventDispatchA . Basically , I want to change the some code in eventDispatchA or , I may just want to skip / omit this function . I can override it . But , will it affect eventDispatchX if I do so ? Or , is there any other better way instead of overriding event observer ?
Most probably it will but if you override something that others might be using it ' s always worth to make something similar : @codeSnippetRemoved
and as others have told you : " if you are in need to change / override the core then you are probably doing it wrong " and it ' s better to ask in different manner by describing what you want to do and why
