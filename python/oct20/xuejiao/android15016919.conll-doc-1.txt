I want to display image on the screen by calling this method in mainActivity @codeSnippetRemoved
But when I launch app it crashes . I will appreciate any help .
activity_main.xml @codeSnippetRemoved

One problem is that the Android device will most likely not have a directory named / BakuMovies / res / drawable-hdpi . This is the directory structure of your development environment and is not directly transferred to the device . Other than that , I cannot give without knowing what you are trying to do .
Edit :
Note that all the resources in your res directory are included in your app ' s .APK file . They are not loaded to the device as individual files . In order to access resources ( other than strings ) in Java code , you need to use a Resources object . You get one by calling getResources() on an Activity object . Once you have the Resources object , call getDrawable() or getDrawableForDensity() to get a drawable resource .
Try this . @codeSnippetRemoved

First you have to add ImageView on your activity_main layout and set its id as android : id= " @+id / imageView " .
There are so many things you could avoid and very easily load the image you want into the ImageView .
Do something like this : - @codeSnippetRemoved
Update : - To insert an ImageView dynamically , do this in your onCreate() . @codeSnippetRemoved
You used drawable . You call setImageDrawable method and than set resource getResources ( ) .getDrawable set id getdrawable method than image will be showing .
The most probable cause is that your application is running out of memory while trying to decode the image in the line below @codeSnippetRemoved
What are the dimensions of this image that you are trying to load ?
In your activity you can call this to get your Drawable resource as a Drawable object and set the image as below : @codeSnippetRemoved
OR
If you want to show your drawable in an ImageView you can do this : @codeSnippetRemoved
or in your xml file @codeSnippetRemoved
