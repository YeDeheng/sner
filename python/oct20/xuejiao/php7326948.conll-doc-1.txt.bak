PHP Script Not Receiving Post Data
I have a php script that is processing a form for me.
However, something is strange (or I'm just a bigger noob than I think).
The following code at the top of the script : @codeSnippetRemoved
Results in the following "printout" when the form is submitted and form data intercepted by the script : @codeSnippetRemoved
I've only included the post array printout to see if post data is actually being received - which, apparently, it is.
So, why is not passing into my variable so that I can USE it?
I know I'm just a PHP hack, but I feel like I must be losing it.
Your code has $_Post and should be $_POST?
Try changing $_Post to $_POST in the lower part of your code ; that may be what ' s causing the problem.
The manual page on the HTTP POST data superglobal array describes it as $_POST.
And, elsewhere :
Basics Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the name of the variable.
The variable name is case-sensitive.
Thus it follows that your use of $_Post should, in fact, read $_POST.
You should fix your error_reporting settings, because you should have seen an E_NOTICE about using a non-existent variable.
