jQuery slide toggle checkbox cant change background colour
I am trying to change the background colour of the toggle to green when it is turned on.
I think I have done everything correctly, but the background just stays grey.
What am I doing wrong?
Here is my fiddle @codeSnippetRemoved
Thanks in advance.
Add the style @codeSnippetRemoved
Demo : Fiddle
If you change the following, its working : @codeSnippetRemoved
So basically just background : instead of background-color :
Updated fiddle : http://jsfiddle.net/84Qkz/2
you need to add this to your css.
This will prevent the override you are currently getting @codeSnippetRemoved
This CSS will solve your problem @codeSnippetRemoved
You are defining the colour of .slider -button as white.
.slider -button is nested inside .slider -frame. slider-frame is given the additional CSS rule that makes it green The green isn't showing because the background colour of the element within it is still white.
Solution ...
Change @codeSnippetRemoved
to ...
@codeSnippetRemoved
So you are now changing the colour of .slider -button, not .slider -frame
Fiddle me this.
