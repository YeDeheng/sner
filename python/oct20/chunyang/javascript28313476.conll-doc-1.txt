How to use gulp-traceur and gulp-webpack ?
I'm trying to compile ES6 js files . I use gulp-traceur and gulp-wepback in gulp pipe line . @codeSnippetRemoved
When running gulp . I take error : Unexpected reserved word . You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type . On the line which contains a " class " word . ( ES6 Syntax )
I can't figure out how to use these plugins together ?
This setup would pass ' js / app.js ' to traceur , but none of the related files , and webpack will then start from that transpiled file and process the rest as normal JS . I'm actually not even sure webpack will get the transpile version of app.js .
The proper way is to use webpack for the main entry point , and tell webpack to transpile all files it comes across . I'd also recommend using Webpack ' s uglifyjs logic instead of tacking it on after-the-fact with gulp . @codeSnippetRemoved
