How can I generate a random number without use of Math.Random ?
My project entails that I create a basic number guessing game that uses the JOptionPane and does not use Math.Random to create the random value . How would you go about doing this ? I've completed everything except the random number generator . Thanks !
If you don't like the Math.Random you can make your own Random object .

If you need other types instead of int , Random will provide methods for boolean , double , float , long , byte .
You could use java.security.SecureRandom . It has better entropy .
Also , here is code from the book Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java . It uses the same algorithm as java.util.Random .
I know that for poker web sites they use things like temperature of the processor , don't know on the top of my head what to use to get this though
Here the code for a Simple random generator : @codeSnippetRemoved
