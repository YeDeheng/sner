php mail duplicates
Is there any reason why this would send duplicate emails ? I have a PHP page with only this code on it and every time I run it it sends me two emails . @codeSnippetRemoved
Maybe your page loads twice , therefore executes the code two times ... You could try some limitation , something like that @codeSnippetRemoved
Is this a simple php page , or part of a CMS ? Maybe some modules might interfere with your page ...
You can try to debug at this way @codeSnippetRemoved
simply put a ' exit ' there and try again . If it still sent twice , maybe is the server problem or could be the [ mail function ] in php.ini ( sendmail_from sendmail_path )
Thanks for the input .
As it turns out this was a browser plugin issue , specifically ySlow 2.1.0 on Firefox 4.0.1
I asked our server manager to look into the problem and he reported that the log was showing two hits every time I went to the page . He tried loading it on his machine and the script worked properly and only loaded once . I tried myself on Chrome and it worked , only emailing once . I went through my various add-ons and finally isolated ySlow as the culprit .
Not sure if this means that ySlow is loading every page twice or what , but I'm going to have to keep it disabled . If anyone has any suggestions about fixing the problem with ySlow , please let me know .
Thanks again .
Just in case , I discovered my code had a command to spare and it generated two emails be sent : @codeSnippetRemoved
I deleted this " \r\n " , it fixed the trouble .
