How can I generate a random number without use of Math.Random?
My project entails that I create a basic number guessing game that uses the JOptionPane and does not use Math.Random to create the random value.
How would you go about doing this?
I've completed everything except the random number generator.
Thanks!
If you don't like the Math.Random you can make your own Random object.

If you need other types instead of int, Random will provide methods for boolean, double, float, long, byte.
You could use java.security.SecureRandom.
It has better entropy.
Also, here is code from the book Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java.
It uses the same algorithm as java.util.Random.
I know that for poker web sites they use things like temperature of the processor, don't know on the top of my head what to use to get this though
Here the code for a Simple random generator : @codeSnippetRemoved
