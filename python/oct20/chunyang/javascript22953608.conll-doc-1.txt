Jquery - Read input from Text Field
I have a form which will populate a select box " city " based on the selections of another select box " suburb " . This works for my data . @codeSnippetRemoved
Instead of having the select id= " suburb " box I would like to make it a text input input type= " text " name= " suburb " and use the value in the input text field to populate the city select box .
I have tried changing it to
@codeSnippetRemoved
But this doesn't return anything . Im sure Im not reading the input in the " suburb " field correctly
Since you give your input name attribute , you can target it by name instead of id : @codeSnippetRemoved
try this @codeSnippetRemoved
