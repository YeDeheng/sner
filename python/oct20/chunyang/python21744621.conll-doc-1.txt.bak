Exception Handling : exception being handled multiple times
I have a python script which downloads certain data from the internet (from a list of URLS) and stores it in a MySQL database.
My code is something along these lines : @codeSnippetRemoved
The data which I fetch could be duplicate and I don't want the duplicate data to be inserted into the database and the code should go over the next iteration etch the next data instead of storing the data.
So I have the except mdb.IntegrityError : line there which takes care of the duplicates.
However, after catching the exception for the duplicate entry the code, instead of going over the next iteration goes to the except which I have set for the for loop.
Here ' s what I get : @codeSnippetRemoved
Why does this happen?
And how do I prevent from happening this?
Thanks a lot!
Your e would not be defined causing exception in your except block.Use mdb.IntegrityError, e like you did for except mdb.Error, e
