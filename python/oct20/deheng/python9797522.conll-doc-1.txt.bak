How do ' and ' and ' or ' act with non-boolean values in Python?
22 and 333 / 12 or 1
I have encountered the above line of code.
The result is 27, but I could not quite understand what does and and or mean in this case.
Can somebody explain to me, preferred with examples.
Thanks in advance !!
A and B returns A if A is false, or B otherwise : @codeSnippetRemoved
Similarly, ' A or B ' returns A if A is true, or B otherwise : @codeSnippetRemoved
Let ' s separate this out : @codeSnippetRemoved
The logical operands and, or will come after division operator in this particular scenario as per the rules of precedence.
First it will calculate 333 / 12 which is 27 and then it will become 22 and 27 or 1 which is equivalent to 27 as and, or have equal precedences.

But in case of Python 3.2 it ' s computing to 27.75.

This is the "and-or trick" -- and and or don't actually return boolean values ; instead, they return one of their input arguments.
People used to use this for control-flow.
As of python 2.5, it ' s not necessary anymore, because conditional expressions were introduced.

is equivalent to @codeSnippetRemoved
In Python, nonzero numbers are counted as true for the purposes of boolean expressions, and zero is counted as false.
So even though both and and or are normally used with the booleans True and False, they can be used with numbers too.
The issue is : what is the value of an expression like 10 and 3, where both of the values evaluate to true?
In C, which has similar integer-as-boolean semantics, the value of 10 3 is 1, the most commonly used true value.
However, in Python the value of this expression is 3, the second half of the and expression.
This makes sense because and short-circuits, meaning that 0 and 3 is 0, so and has "take the first value if it ' s false, the second otherwise" semantics.
What about the expression you posted?
By operator precedence, it ' s the same as @codeSnippetRemoved
The value of 22 and 333 / 12 is 333 / 12, which is 27.
Since the or operator short-circuits, the Python interpreter takes the first true value when evaluating 27 or 1, and gets 27.
