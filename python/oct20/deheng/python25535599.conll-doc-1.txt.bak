Options for linting Cython code
I have a Cython module that I would like to lint PEP8 style, however pylint syntax errors on Cython cdef syntax.
Does anyone have a suggestion about how to maintain Python coding standards for Cython code?
Although not command-line based, PyCharm claims to have Cython support.
Unfortunately, it ' s only available on the paid-version "Professional Edition".
