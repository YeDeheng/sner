How to avoid repeatedly adding the checked value to the input text box
I am working on a project where I want to add the radio button value to the input field .
The input field is to add a name , and radio button is used to select the sex . By default it should be " My Name " on the input field , and when the user checks the radio button , it should add the text " I am a { radio button value} " .
I've managed to do some of this , but the problem is :
When I switch the radio button it keeps on adding the text , and it looks silly . By default it shows the value " I am a undefined " where it should be " my Name " How can I validate that the user has selected the sex when they submit ?

Thanks for the help .
First you execute the function displayVals() ; on dom ready without a radio is selected so the input text get the vaule of undefined . Second you add the old value everytime on radio change . Take a look here :
function displayVals() { var a = $("input[type='radio ' ]: checked ") .val() ; var b = " I am a " ; var checkedValue = $ ( " p ") .html ( " b I am a / b " + " " + a ); var input = $("input[type='text ' ] ") ; // you want to add only the value of radio each time . input.val(a);}$("input[type='radio ' ] ") .change ( displayVals ); // why execute this one on dom ready ?? // displayVals() ; script src= " https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js " / script input type= " text " onblur= " this.placeholder = ' my name '" onfocus= " this.placeholder = ''" placeholder= " my name " name= " name " id= " my name " class= " InputText " input type= " submit " value= " Submit " class= " SubmitButton " br input type= " radio " id= " single " name= " sex " value= " Boy " Boy nbsp ; nbsp ; | nbsp ; nbsp ; input type= " radio " id= " single " name= " sex " value= " Girl " Girl br br br br p / p select id= " single " option Single / option option Single2 / option / select

To avoid duplicate result , don't reappend the input.val in it : @codeSnippetRemoved
Check if the value is undefined before filling the input and the p : @codeSnippetRemoved
To validate before submit : @codeSnippetRemoved
I put it on the submit button to show you the behavior but you should put it in the form submit event .
OK , there are several things :
Remove the onblur and onfocus from the input text definition , placeholder already behaves like that . Remove the call to displayVals() at the end of the script Remove the input.val() + in the reassignation of the input.val For the validation , you may add the keyword required to the definition of either input radio tags , or even both .
