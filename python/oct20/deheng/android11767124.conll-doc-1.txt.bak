Android Path : Merge several paths and draw text on merged path
In my application I have to merge several short paths to create a larger one.
Example : @codeSnippetRemoved
This works just fine and draws a neat V-shape to the canvas.
However if I want to use the merged path for text rendering (using Canvas.drawTextOnPath()), it only draws text along the first part of the path (i.e. the original p1).
I'd like to use the entire path for text rendering, though.
So is there a way to achieve that?
Do you have to use two paths?
You can try using one like : @codeSnippetRemoved
and then use the the Canvas.drawTextOnPath() on p1
Hope that helps.
Figured this out myself ...
The behavior described seems to be a known issue.
I guess this is due to the fact that every path is internally seen as a separate "contour" which cannot be merged with another one.
However I was able to get the desired behavior with a simple "hack".
This only works for line-based paths, though.
Here ' s the code (minimal example), just if anyone ' s interested ...
@codeSnippetRemoved
The usage of this is straightforward : @codeSnippetRemoved
Path.addPath() still seems to be work-in-progress.
You can avoid using it without extending Path by appending the multiple segments directly to the Path you will draw.
