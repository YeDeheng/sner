what is this permissionif i delete d.getWindow() .setType (WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT ); my app is correct .....
try this in your menifest file with Activity that you want to show as pop-up.
-->> android : theme= "@android : style / Theme.Dialog"
Add this permission to your manifest : @codeSnippetRemoved
First of all thanks to Mathias Lin
I am new to Android so it was hard to me to set permission knowing from Mathias Lin ' s answer.Because I didn't know how to set permission and where in the manifest file.
Finally I did it by help of Mathias Lin ' s answer.
So I made the answer elaborate.
In mainfest file use @codeSnippetRemoved
after @codeSnippetRemoved
as @codeSnippetRemoved
