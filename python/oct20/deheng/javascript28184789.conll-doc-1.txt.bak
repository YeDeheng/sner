"myfirst" is not the class name, it ' s the animation name.with "#div1" you're searching for the id "div1", but your elements class name is "div1" (select it with a dot : $ (' .div1 ')) .You have to execute your javascript after the dom is loaded.
Currently you're searching for the id "button" before the element is loaded.You're using jquery, so you can execute your code inside $ (function() { / * here * / } ); or just move the script to the bottom.
here the animation part (Demo : http://jsfiddle.net/FirePanther/q4bedpdz ): @codeSnippetRemoved
edit : without the opacity transition and without hiding the element after the animation : http://jsfiddle.net/FirePanther/L2pf5wku/1
If u need the animation to be infinite loop, the animation iteration count should be infinite.
