Android Path : Merge several paths and draw text on merged path
In my application I have to merge several short paths to create a larger one . Example : @codeSnippetRemoved
This works just fine and draws a neat V-shape to the canvas .
However if I want to use the merged path for text rendering ( using Canvas.drawTextOnPath() ) , it only draws text along the first part of the path ( i.e. the original p1 ) . I'd like to use the entire path for text rendering , though . So is there a way to achieve that ?
Do you have to use two paths ? You can try using one like : @codeSnippetRemoved
and then use the the Canvas.drawTextOnPath() on p1
Hope that helps .
Figured this out myself ... The behavior described seems to be a known issue . I guess this is due to the fact that every path is internally seen as a separate " contour " which cannot be merged with another one .
However I was able to get the desired behavior with a simple " hack " . This only works for line-based paths , though . Here ' s the code ( minimal example ) , just if anyone ' s interested ... @codeSnippetRemoved
The usage of this is straightforward : @codeSnippetRemoved
Path.addPath() still seems to be work-in-progress . You can avoid using it without extending Path by appending the multiple segments directly to the Path you will draw . @codeSnippetRemoved
