Prevent MySQL PDO from returning numbers as strings
I am using PHP ' s PDO to query a MySQL database . It returns numbers and integers as strings , and is messing with my JSON .
Is there a better way of fixing it other than type casting the values row by row ? @codeSnippetRemoved
If you are using php 5.3.3 or higher you can use JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK as the second argument to json_encode to do this .
See : http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
Although @Explosion Pills works in this case for @user1032531 ' s needs , it ' s not addressing the 1st source of the problem .
As you can see in the original question , on the PHP side the value from sell_price is already a string , although , as the user said , in the database it ' s stored as a " number " ( we don't know if it ' s a DECIMAL or a FLOAT ) .
Well , when using PDO with MySQL a proper config may be required in order to get " numbers " as " numbers " , as user @jameshfisher pointed out in his comment . You can follow his link in order to get almost everything you need to get it working .
Appart from that , the accepted answer is working because without the use of the JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK json_encode will send everything as text no matter the type of the variable , and when using it it will convert the value to a type based on guesses rather than the type of the original var .
