JavaScript not working in Internet Explorer
I am having this dynamic dropdown code.
Here i want to load the second dropdown options dynamically by changing the first dropdown options.
This works fine in all other browsers except IE.
I don't know whats the reason as i'm a starter. could any one explain the reason.
HTML CODE : @codeSnippetRemoved
JS CODE @codeSnippetRemoved
It appears that non-IE browsers (e.g. Chrome) will set the value of an option tag implicitly using it ' s inner-text, but IE does not do this.
You have two options :
1) Set the option value explicitly @codeSnippetRemoved
Or,
2) Switch on text @codeSnippetRemoved
(Tested in Chrome and IE9.)
Try the alternative using older method to dynamically add option
@codeSnippetRemoved
