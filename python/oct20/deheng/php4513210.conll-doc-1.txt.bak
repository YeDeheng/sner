function / command to retrieve web content (besides from wget or file_get_contents)
I need to retrieve a web content.
I usually use wget but it ' s giving me an "Internal Server Error" this time.
I also tried using file_get_contents(), it works when I'm using MAMP installed in my Mac, but when I run it in our server, it ' s not doing anything and prints no error message.
Is there any other way to do this?
Below are the code that I used.
@codeSnippetRemoved
Thanks in advance !!
I don't know how to reply to all of you so I just added it here.
CURL WORKED PERFECTLY.
Thanks a lot guys.
I just have to ask though why file_get_contents() won't work even if it ' s enabled in the php.ini?
I would guess that you don't have the fopen wrappers enabled.
To test, do : @codeSnippetRemoved
If this returns false (or 0, can't remember which), you can't use file_get_contents to open a remote file.
If cURL is installed, you can use that to access remote files.
allow_url_fopen may be turned off by your web host.
You should see if this can be turned on.
If not, cURL may still available so you should try using that instead.
If cURL is available to you, use that.
You can determine if cURL is installed by doing a phpinfo() ;.
For more information on cURL : PHP : cURL
Please reference http://davidwalsh.name/download-urls-content-php-curl for a solid example of using PHP ' s implementation of CURL to fetch the contents located at a given URL.
I believe you'll find the process fairly straightforward.
You can use cURL : @codeSnippetRemoved
function curl ($url) { $ch = curl_init() ; curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url ); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1 ); return curl_exec ($ch ); curl_close ($ch ); }
$html = curl ("http://www4.honolulu.gov/hpdtraffic/MainPrograms/frmMain.asp?sSearch=All+Incidents sSort=I_tTimeCreate ") ;
