ajax adding information to database
im still fairly new to the whole ruby on rails stuff, though i have read that you can easily perform ajax requests. what im trying to do is add a new row to the database table, and pass a few variables from it.
what i have at present is @codeSnippetRemoved
controller code
# POST / availabilities # POST / availabilities.json def create @availability = Availability.new (params [: availability ]) @codeSnippetRemoved
end
though how does it know what variables to pass to the database?
this is what is happening at present
Processing by AvailabilitiesController #create as HTML Parameters : { "schedule_id" = "18", "team_id" = "1", "user_id" = "38" } User Load (1.6ms) SELECT "users".
* FROM "users" WHERE "users".
"id" = 38 LIMIT 1 (0.4ms) BEGIN SQL (20.1ms) INSERT INTO "availabilities" ("available", "created_at", "schedule_id", "team_id", "updated_at", "user_id ") VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6) RETURNING" id "[[" available ", nil], [" created_at ", Tue, 18 Sep 2012 23:07 : 26 EST + 10:00 ], [" schedule_id ", nil], [" team_id ", nil], [" updated_at ", Tue, 18 Sep 2012 23:07 : 26 EST + 10:00 ], [" user_id ", nil ]] (10.5ms) COMMIT
If you want to pass information to your rails app, you will need to place the @codeSnippetRemoved
on to the form_for tag, then your controller will be able to pass those params on to your model.
If you want to pass more than one variable to the server you include them in the http request.
This is true for AJAX requests as well as regular ones.
For example : @codeSnippetRemoved
Often though with more complex submissions you'll want to use a remote form rather than just a simple link.
