How to connect draggable divs
I have some divs that I clone and can drag and drop in a area, now, I want to connect by lines the divs and if I move the divs, this lines must move too.
Something like a flow diagram, I clone the divs using drag and drop, but still don't know how to do this lines.
Thanks!
I've thought about this before but I've never had a need to actually try to implement it.
Try this :
Create a transparent GIF or PNG that has a diagonal line running from one corner to another.
As you drag the divs around, stretch the image so that it ' s corners are always touching each div.
You will probably need a diagonal-down image and a diagonal-up image and switch between the two based on the relative positioning of the two divs.
This will probably take some finesse to get it working well, but it is the best thing that I can think of to get diagonal lines in HTML.
take two divs, divA and divB. calculate the shortest distance between the closest borders of the divs determine the middle coordinates of those closest sides of each diveg :
A : { x : 10, y : 10 }
B : { x : 20 : y : 10 } determine the intersection-point of lines from those points (C) C = AX, BY or AY, BX (depending on divA and divB positions) create two divs, that represent AC and BC
tip : @codeSnippetRemoved
repaint every time you move the divs with jquery.
note : as you can see, there are always 2 sides close and 2 sides far when the divs are not parallel.
you can use jsplumb library to achieve this.
if you have two divs, div1 and div2, @codeSnippetRemoved
this should establish the connectors.
if your divs are movables, then onmove, make a call to jsPlumb.repaint()

Hope this helps. good luck
