Email Attachment from memory stream is coming as blank in C#
I am able to send an attachment in a mail but the attachment content is blank and size is being shown as 0 bytes.
After doing some search over the internet found that we need to reset the memory stream position to 0 in order to start from start.
I tried that as well but it seems it is not working.
Can you please help?
Please find below my code snippet :
NOTE : I am able to save the workbook and Data is present in the saved workbook.

I think the attachment is confusing the mail system.
Microsoft ' s recommendation is to specify the content type as an octet.
Below is a replacement for initializing the attachment.
The reset of your code looks fine.
