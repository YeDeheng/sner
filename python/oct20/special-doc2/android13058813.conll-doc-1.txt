I can not seem to stop my own service
I have a service that places a red rectangle on the screen and has a onDestroy() that looks like this @codeSnippetRemoved
from one of my activities i am calling to kill this service like so : @codeSnippetRemoved
i see the toast come up saying that the onDestroy() has been called but i still see the red rectangle and it is still running ..
my manifest is using : @codeSnippetRemoved
myService @codeSnippetRemoved
Firstly you don't need to have that permission to stop a service that you create .
I use services frequently ( starting and stopping ) and I assure you I don't ever use that permission .
ie : @codeSnippetRemoved
is all you need .
Of course your service does need to be declared in your Android Manifest .
Now anything that affects your activity uses the context inside that activity .
So killing your service won't change what ' s on the UI .
In your services on Destroy , you should need to somehow reference the rectangle object and remove it that way .
I have no idea how you created the rectangle .
But if it is a view , you could set it to VISIBILITY.GONE , or if it ' s a ViewStub , you can deflate it , if it ' s an object you can clear it , etc ..
If you are saying your service is still running even after you call the stop service function , then something else is wrong .
