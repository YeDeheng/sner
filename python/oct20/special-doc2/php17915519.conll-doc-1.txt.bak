Issue with substr based on variable MYSQL IPN
Hello I'm having trouble trying to figure out why I'm getting no addition to my username column within my table.
I'm trying to use the payer email within my IPN to introduce a username for login.
Everything is being posted except for the username.
Is there something I'm doing wrong within the placement of the username variable edits?
Is there something I'm missing that is preventing this from being posted?

Edit :
I'vej ust updated the script.
The error I'm receiving is as follows :

Line 108 being
while ($name_arr = mysqli_fetch_assoc ($result )) {
I haven't played around with this too much, but the piece of code which stands out for me as chiefly suspect is : @codeSnippetRemoved
It should probably look more like @codeSnippetRemoved
