I can not seem to stop my own service
I have a service that places a red rectangle on the screen and has a onDestroy() that looks like this @codeSnippetRemoved
from one of my activities i am calling to kill this service like so : @codeSnippetRemoved
i see the toast come up saying that the onDestroy() has been called but i still see the red rectangle and it is still running ..
my manifest is using : @codeSnippetRemoved
myService @codeSnippetRemoved
Firstly you don't need to have that permission to stop a service that you create.
I use services frequently (starting and stopping) and I assure you I don't ever use that permission.
ie : @codeSnippetRemoved
is all you need.
Of course your service does need to be declared in your Android Manifest.
Now anything that affects your activity uses the context inside that activity.
So killing your service won't change what ' s on the UI.
In your services on Destroy, you should need to somehow reference the rectangle object and remove it that way.
I have no idea how you created the rectangle.
But if it is a view, you could set it to VISIBILITY.GONE, or if it ' s a ViewStub, you can deflate it, if it ' s an object you can clear it, etc ..
If you are saying your service is still running even after you call the stop service function, then something else is wrong.
